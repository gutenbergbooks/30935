<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page1"></a>1</span></p>

<p>CONSTANTINE PAVLOVICH (1779-1831), grand-duke and
cesarevich of Russia, was born at Tsarskoye Selo on the 27th
of April 1779. Of the sons born to the unfortunate tsar Paul
Petrovich and his wife Maria Feodorovna, <i>née</i> princess of Württemberg,
none more closely resembled his father in bodily
and mental characteristics than did the second, Constantine
Pavlovich. The direction of the boy&rsquo;s upbringing was entirely
in the hands of his grandmother, the empress Catherine II. As
in the case of her eldest grandson (afterwards the emperor
Alexander I.), she regulated every detail of his physical and
mental education; but in accordance with her usual custom
she left the carrying out of her views to the men who were in
her confidence. Count Nicolai Ivanovich Soltikov was supposed
to be the actual tutor, but he too in his turn transferred the
burden to another, only interfering personally on quite exceptional
occasions, and exercised neither a positive nor a negative
influence upon the character of the exceedingly passionate,
restless and headstrong boy. The only person who really took
him in hand was César La Harpe, who was tutor-in-chief from
1783 to May 1795 and educated both the empress&rsquo;s grandsons.</p>

<p>Like Alexander, Constantine was married by Catherine when
not yet seventeen years of age, a raw and immature boy, and
he made his wife, Juliana of Coburg, intensely miserable. After
a first separation in the year 1799, she went back permanently
to her German home in 1801, the victim of a frivolous intrigue,
in the guilt of which she was herself involved. An attempt made
by Constantine in 1814 to win her back to his hearth and home
broke down on her firm opposition. During the time of this
tragic marriage Constantine&rsquo;s first campaign took place under
the leadership of the great Suvorov. The battle of Bassignano
was lost by Constantine&rsquo;s fault, but at Novi he distinguished
himself by such personal bravery that the emperor Paul bestowed
on him the title of cesarevich, which according to the
fundamental law of the constitution belonged only to the heir
to the throne. Though it cannot be proved that this action of
the tsar denoted any far-reaching plan, it yet shows that Paul
already distrusted the grand-duke Alexander. However that
may be, it is certain that Constantine never tried to secure the
throne. After his father&rsquo;s death he led a wild and disorderly
bachelor life. He abstained from politics, but remained faithful
to his military inclinations, though, indeed, without manifesting
anything more than a preference for the externalities of the
service.</p>

<p>In command of the guards during the campaign of 1805
Constantine had a share of the responsibility for the unfortunate
turn which events took at the battle of Austerlitz; while in
1807 neither his skill nor his fortune in war showed any improvement.
However, after the peace of Tilsit he became an ardent
admirer of the great Corsican and an upholder of the Russo-French
alliance. It was on this account that in political questions
he did not enjoy the confidence of his imperial brother. To the
latter the French alliance had always been merely a means to
an end, and after he had satisfied himself at Erfurt, and later
during the Franco-Austrian War of 1809, that Napoleon likewise
regarded his relation to Russia only from the point of view
of political advantage, he became convinced that the alliance
must transform itself into a battle of life and death. Such
insight was never attained by Constantine; even in 1812, after
the fall of Moscow, he pressed for a speedy conclusion of peace
with Napoleon, and, like field-marshal Kutusov, he too opposed
the policy which carried the war across the Russian frontier to
a victorious conclusion upon French soil. During the campaign
he was a boon companion of every commanding-officer. Barclay
de Tolly was twice obliged to send him away from the army.
His share in the battles in Germany and France was insignificant.
At Dresden, on the 26th of August, his military knowledge
failed him at the decisive moment, but at La Fère-Champenoise
he distinguished himself by personal bravery. On the whole he
cut no great figure. In Paris the grand-duke excited public
ridicule by the manifestation of his petty military fads. His
first visit was to the stables, and it was said that he had marching
and drilling even in his private rooms.</p>

<p>In the great political decisions of those days Constantine took
not the smallest part. His importance in political history dates
only from the moment when the emperor Alexander entrusted
him in Poland with a task which enabled him to concentrate all
the one-sidedness of his talents and all the doggedness of his
nature on a definite object: that of the militarization and
outward discipline of Poland. With this begins the part played
by the grand-duke in history. In the Congress-Poland created
by Alexander he received the post of commander-in-chief of the
forces of the kingdom; to which was added later (1819) the
command of the Lithuanian troops and of those of the Russian
provinces that had formerly belonged to the kingdom of Poland.
In effect he was the actual ruler of the country, and soon became
the most zealous advocate of the separate position of Poland
created by the constitution granted by Alexander. He organized
their army for the Poles, and felt himself more a Pole than a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>2</span>
Russian, especially after his marriage, on the 27th of May 1820,
with a Polish lady, Johanna Grudzinska. Connected with this
was his renunciation of any claim to the Russian succession,
which was formally completed in 1822. It is well known how,
in spite of this, when Alexander I. died on the 1st of December
1825 the grand-duke Nicholas had him proclaimed emperor
in St Petersburg, in connexion with which occurred the famous
revolt of the Russian Liberals, known as the rising of the
Dekabrists. In this crisis Constantine&rsquo;s attitude had been
very correct, far more so than that of his brother, which was
vacillating and uncertain. Under the emperor Nicholas also
Constantine maintained his position in Poland. But differences
soon arose between him and his brother in consequence of the
share taken by the Poles in the Dekabrist conspiracy. Constantine
hindered the unveiling of the organized plotting for
independence which had been going on in Poland for many
years, and held obstinately to the belief that the army and the
bureaucracy were loyally devoted to the Russian empire. The
eastern policy of the tsar and the Turkish War of 1828 and 1829
caused a fresh breach between them. It was owing to the opposition
of Constantine that the Polish army took no part in this
war, so that there was in consequence no Russo-Polish comradeship
in arms, such as might perhaps have led to a reconciliation
between the two nations.</p>

<p>The insurrection at Warsaw in November 1830 took Constantine
completely by surprise. It was owing to his utter failure
to grasp the situation that the Polish regiments passed over to
the revolutionaries; and during the continuance of the revolution
he showed himself as incompetent as he was lacking in judgment.
Every defeat of the Russians appeared to him almost in the
light of a personal gratification: <i>his</i> soldiers were victorious.
The suppression of the revolution he did not live to see. He
died of cholera at Vitebsk on the 27th of June 1831. He was
an impossible man in an impossible situation. On the Russian
imperial throne he would in all probability have been a tyrant
like his father.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONSTANTINE,</span> a city of Algeria, capital of the department
of the same name, 54 m. by railway S. by W. of the port of
Philippeville, in 36° 22&prime; N., 6° 36&prime; E. Constantine is the residence
of a general commanding a division, of a prefect and other high
officials, is the seat of a bishop, and had a population in 1906
of 46,806, of whom 25,312 were Europeans. The population of
the commune, which includes the suburbs of Constantine, was
58,435. The city occupies a romantic position on a rocky
plateau, cut off on all sides save the west from the surrounding
country by a beautiful ravine, through which the river Rummel
flows. The plateau is 2130 ft. above sea-level, and from 500 to
nearly 1000 ft. above the river bed. The ravine, formed by
the Rummel, through erosion of the limestone, varies greatly in
width&mdash;at its narrowest part the cliffs are only 15 ft. apart, at
its broadest the valley is 400 yds. wide. At the N.E. angle of the
city the gorge is spanned by an iron bridge (El-Kantara) built
in 1863, giving access to the railway station, situated on Mansura
hill. A stone bridge built by the Romans, and restored at
various times, suddenly gave way in 1857 and is now in ruins;
it was built on a natural arch, which, 184 ft. above the level of
the river, spans the valley. Along the north-eastern side of
the city the Rummel is spanned in all four times by these natural
stone arches or tunnels. To the north the city is commanded
by the Jebel Mecid, a hill which the French (following the example
of the Romans) have fortified.</p>

<p>Constantine is walled, the extant medieval wall having been
largely constructed out of Roman material. Through the centre
from north to south runs a street (the rue de France) roughly
dividing Constantine into two parts. The place du Palais, in
which are the palace of the governor and the cathedral, and the
kasbah (citadel) are west of the rue de France, as is likewise
the place Négrier, containing the law courts. The native town
lies chiefly in the south-east part of the city. A striking contrast
exists between the Moorish quarter, with its tortuous lanes
and Oriental architecture, and the modern quarter, with its
rectangular streets and wide open squares, frequently bordered
with trees and adorned with fountains. Of the squares the
place de Nemours is the centre of the commercial and social life
of the city. Of the public buildings those dating from before the
French occupation possess chief interest. The palace, built
by Ahmed Pasha, the last bey of Constantine, between 1830
and 1836, is one of the finest specimens of Moorish architecture
of the 19th century. The kasbah, which occupies the northern
corner of the city, dates from Roman times, and preserves in
its more modern portions numerous remains of other Roman
edifices. It is now turned into barracks and a hospital. The fine
mosque of Sidi-el-Kattani (or Salah Bey) dates from the close of
the 18th century; that of Suk-er-Rezel, now transformed into a
cathedral, and called <i>Notre-Dame des Sept Douleurs</i>, was built
about a century earlier. The Great Mosque, or Jamaa-el-Kebir,
occupies the site of what was probably an ancient pantheon.
The mosque Sidi-el-Akhdar has a beautiful minaret nearly
80 ft. high. The museum, housed in the hôtel de ville, contains a
fine collection of antiquities, including a famous bronze statuette
of the winged figure of Victory, 23 in. high, discovered in the
kasbah in 1858.</p>

<p>A religious seminary, or medressa, is maintained in connexion
with the Sidi-el-Kattani; and the French support a college and
various minor educational establishments for both Arabic and
European culture. The native industry of Constantine is chiefly
confined to leather goods and woollen fabrics. Some 100,000
burnouses are made annually, the finest partly of wool and
partly of silk. There is also an active trade in embossing or
engraving copper and brass utensils. A considerable trade is
carried on over a large area by means of railway connexion with
Algiers, Bona, Tunis and Biskra, as well as with Philippeville.
The railways, however, have taken away from the city its
monopoly of the traffic in wheat, though its share in that trade
still amounts to from £400,000 to £480,000 a year.</p>

<p>Constantine, or, as it was originally called, Cirta or Kirtha,
from the Phoenician word for a city, was in ancient times one
of the most important towns of Numidia, and the residence of
the kings of the Massyli. Under Micipsa (2nd century B.C.)
it reached the height of its prosperity, and was able to furnish
an army of 10,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry. Though it
afterwards declined, it still continued an important military
post, and is frequently mentioned during successive wars.
Caesar having bestowed a part of its territory on his supporter
Sittius, the latter introduced a Roman settlement, and the town
for a time was known as Colonia Sittianorum. In the war of
Maxentius against Alexander, the Numidian usurper, it was laid
in ruins; and on its restoration in A.D. 313 by Constantine it
received the name which it still retains. It was not captured
during the Vandal invasion of Africa, but on the conquest by
the Arabians (7th century) it shared the same fate as the
surrounding country. Successive Arab dynasties looted it,
and many monuments of antiquity suffered (to be finally swept
away by &ldquo;municipal improvements&rdquo; under the French régime).
During the 12th century it was still a place of considerable
prosperity; and its commerce was extensive enough to attract
the merchants of Pisa, Genoa and Venice. Frequently taken
and retaken by the Turks, Constantine finally became under
their dominion the seat of a bey, subordinate to the dey of
Algiers. To Salah Bey, who ruled from 1770 to 1792, we owe
most of the existing Moslem buildings. In 1826 Constantine
asserted its independence of the dey of Algiers, and was governed
by Haji Ahmed, the choice of the Kabyles. In 1836 the French
under Marshal Clausel made an unsuccessful attempt to storm
the city, which they attacked by night by way of El-Kantara.
The French suffered heavy loss. In 1837 Marshal Valée
approached the town by the connecting western isthmus,
and succeeded in taking it by assault, though again the French
lost heavily. Ahmed, however, escaped and maintained his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>3</span>
independence in the Aures mountains. He submitted to the
French in 1848 and died in 1850.</p>

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CONSTANTINOPLE,</span> the capital of the Turkish empire,
situated in 41° 0&prime; 16&Prime; N. and 28° 58&prime; 14&Prime; E. The city stands at
the southern extremity of the Bosporus, upon a hilly promontory
that runs out from the European or western side of the straits
towards the opposite Asiatic bank, as though to stem the rush
of waters from the Black Sea into the Sea of Marmora. Thus
the promontory has the latter sea on the south, and the bay of
the Bosporus, forming the magnificent harbour known as the
Golden Horn, some 4 m. long, on the north. Two streams, the
Cydaris and Barbysus of ancient days, the Ali-Bey-Su and
Kiahat-Hané-Su of modern times, enter the bay at its north-western
end. A small winter stream, named the Lycus, that
flows through the promontory from west to south-east into the
Sea of Marmora, breaks the hilly ground into two great masses,&mdash;a
long ridge, divided by cross-valleys into six eminences, overhanging
the Golden Horn, and a large isolated hill constituting
the south-western portion of the territory. Hence the claim of
Constantinople to be enthroned, like Rome, upon seven hills.
The 1st hill is distinguished by the Seraglio, St Sophia and the
Hippodrome; the 2nd by the column of Constantine and
the mosque Nuri-Osmanieh; the 3rd by the war office, the
Seraskereate Tower and the mosque of Sultan Suleiman; the
4th by the mosque of Sultan Mahommed II., the Conqueror;
the 5th by the mosque of Sultan Selim; the 6th by Tekfour
Serai and the quarter of Egri Kapu; the 7th by Avret Tash
and the quarter of Psamatia. In Byzantine times the two last
hills were named respectively the hill of Blachernae and the
Xerolophos or dry hill.</p>

<p><i>History, Architecture and Antiquities.</i>&mdash;Constantinople is
famous in history, first as the capital of the Roman empire in
the East for more than eleven centuries (330-1453), and secondly
as the capital of the Ottoman empire since 1453. In respect
of influence over the course of human affairs, its only rivals are
Athens, Rome and Jerusalem. Yet even the gifts of these
rivals to the cause of civilization often bear the image and
superscription of Constantinople upon them. Roman law,
Greek literature, the theology of the Christian church, for
example, are intimately associated with the history of the city
beside the Bosporus.</p>

<p>The city was founded by Constantine the Great, through the
enlargement of the old town of Byzantium, in A.D. 328, and was
inaugurated as a new seat of government on the 11th of May,
A.D. 330. To indicate its political dignity, it was named New
Rome, while to perpetuate the fame of its founder it was styled
Constantinople. The chief patriarch of the Greek church still
signs himself &ldquo;archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome.&rdquo;
The old name of the place, Byzantium, however, continued
in use.</p>

<p>The creation of a new capital by Constantine was not an act
of personal caprice or individual judgment. It was the result
of causes long in operation, and had been foreshadowed, forty
years before, in the policy of Diocletian. After the senate and
people of Rome had ceased to be the sovereigns of the Roman
world, and their authority had been vested in the sole person
of the emperor, the eternal city could no longer claim to be the
rightful throne of the state. That honour could henceforth be
conferred upon any place in the Roman world which might suit
the convenience of the emperor, or serve more efficiently the
interests he had to guard. Furthermore, the empire was now
upon its defence. Dreams of conquests and extension had long
been abandoned, and the pressing question of the time was how
to repel the persistent assaults of Persia and the barbarians upon
the frontiers of the realm, and so retain the dominion inherited
from the valour of the past. The size of the empire made it
difficult, if not impossible, to attend to these assaults, or to control
the ambition of successful generals, from one centre. Then the
East had grown in political importance, both as the scene of the
most active life in the state and as the portion of the empire
most exposed to attack. Hence the famous scheme of Diocletian
to divide the burden of government between four colleagues, in
order to secure a better administration of civil and of military
affairs. It was a scheme, however, that lowered the prestige
of Rome, for it involved four distinct seats of government, among
which, as the event proved, no place was found for the ancient
capital of the Roman world. It also declared the high position
of the East, by the selection of Nicomedia in Asia Minor as the
residence of Diocletian himself. When Constantine, therefore,
established a new seat of government at Byzantium, he adopted
a policy inaugurated before his day as essential to the preservation
of the Roman dominion. He can claim originality only in
his choice of the particular point at which that seat was placed,
and in his recognition of the fact that his alliance with the
Christian church could be best maintained in a new atmosphere.</p>

<p>But whatever view may be taken of the policy which divided
the government of the empire, there can be no dispute as to the
wisdom displayed in the selection of the site for a new imperial
throne, &ldquo;Of all the events of Constantine&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; says Dean
Stanley, &ldquo;this choice is the most convincing and enduring proof
of his real genius.&rdquo; Situated where Europe and Asia are parted
by a channel never more than 5 m. across, and sometimes
less than half a mile wide, placed at a point commanding the
great waterway between the Mediterranean and the Black
Sea, the position affords immense scope for commercial enterprise
and political action in rich and varied regions of the world. The
least a city in that situation can claim as its appropriate sphere
of influence is the vast domain extending from the Adriatic to
the Persian Gulf, and from the Danube to the eastern Mediterranean.
Moreover, the site constituted a natural citadel,
difficult to approach or to invest, and an almost impregnable
refuge in the hour of defeat, within which broken forces might
rally to retrieve disaster. To surround it, an enemy required
to be strong upon both land and sea. Foes advancing through
Asia Minor would have their march arrested, and their blows
kept beyond striking distance, by the moat which the waters
of the Bosporus, the Sea of Marmora and the Dardanelles
combine to form. The narrow straits in which the waterway
connecting the Mediterranean with the Black Sea contracts,
both to the north and to the south of the city, could be rendered
impassable to hostile fleets approaching from either direction,
while on the landward side the line of defence was so short that
it could be strongly fortified, and held against large numbers
by a comparatively small force. Nature, indeed, cannot relieve
men of their duty to be wise and brave, but, in the marvellous
configuration of land and sea about Constantinople, nature has
done her utmost to enable human skill and courage to establish
there the splendid and stable throne of a great empire.</p>

<p>Byzantium, out of which Constantinople sprang, was a small,
well-fortified town, occupying most of the territory comprised
in the two hills nearest the head of the promontory, and in the
level ground at their base. The landward wall started from a
point near the present Stamboul custom-house, and reached the
ridge of the 2nd hill, a little to the east of the point marked by
Chemberli Tash (the column of Constantine). There the principal
gate of the town opened upon the Egnatian road. From that
gate the wall descended towards the Sea of Marmora, touching
the water in the neighbourhood of the Seraglio lighthouse. The
Acropolis, enclosing venerated temples, crowned the summit of
the first hill, where the Seraglio stands. Immediately to the
south of the fortress was the principal market-place of the town,
surrounded by porticoes on its four sides, and hence named the
Tetrastoon. On the southern side of the square stood the baths
of Zeuxippus, and beyond them, still farther south, lay the
Hippodrome, which Septimius Severus had undertaken to build
but failed to complete. Two theatres, on the eastern slope of
the Acropolis, faced the bright waters of the Marmora, and a
stadium was found on the level tract on the other side of the hill,
close to the Golden Horn. The Strategion, devoted to the
military exercises of the brave little town, stood close to Sirkedji
Iskelessi, and two artificial harbours, the Portus Prosforianus
and the Neorion, indented the shore of the Golden Horn, respectively
in front of the ground now occupied by the station of
the Chemins de Fer Orientaux and the Stamboul custom-house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>4</span>
A graceful granite column, still erect on the slope above the head
of the promontory, commemorated the victory of Claudius
Gothicus over the Goths at Nissa, A.D. 269. All this furniture
of Byzantium was appropriated for the use of the new capital.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Zosimus, the line of the landward walls erected
by Constantine to defend New Rome was drawn at a distance of
nearly 2 m. (15 stadia) to the west of the limits of the old town.
It therefore ran across the promontory from the vicinity of Un
Kapan Kapusi (Porta Platea), at the Stamboul head of the
Inner Bridge, to the neighbourhood of Daud Pasha Kapusi
(Porta S. Aemiliani), on the Marmora, and thus added the 3rd
and 4th hills and portions of the 5th and 7th hills to the territory
of Byzantium. We have two indications of the course of these
walls on the 7th hill. One is found in the name Isa Kapusi (the
Gate of Jesus) attached to a mosque, formerly a Christian church,
situated above the quarter of Psamatia. It perpetuates the
memory of the beautiful gateway which formed the triumphal
entrance into the city of Constantine, and which survived the
original bounds of the new capital as late as 1508, when it was
overthrown by an earthquake. The other indication is the name
Alti Mermer (the six columns) given to a quarter in the same
neighbourhood. The name is an ignorant translation of Exakionion,
the corrupt form of the designation Exokionion, which
belonged in Byzantine days to that quarter because marked by
a column outside the city limits. Hence the Arians, upon their
expulsion from the city by Theodosius I., were allowed to hold
their religious services in the Exokionion, seeing that it was an
extra-mural district. This explains the fact that Arians are
sometimes styled Exokionitae by ecclesiastical historians.
The Constantinian line of fortifications, therefore, ran a little
to the east of the quarter of Alti Mermer. In addition to the
territory enclosed within the limits just described, the suburb
of Sycae or Galata, on the opposite side of the Golden Horn,
and the suburb of Blachernae, on the 6th hill, were regarded
as parts of the city, but stood within their own fortifications.
It was to the ramparts of Constantine that the city owed its
deliverance when attacked by the Goths, after the terrible
defeat of Valens at Adrianople, A.D. 378.</p>

<p>In the opinion of his courtiers, the bounds assigned to New
Rome by Constantine seemed, it is said, too wide, but after
some eighty years they proved too narrow for the population
that had gathered within the city. The barbarians had meantime
also grown more formidable, and this made it necessary to have
stronger fortifications for the capital. Accordingly, in 413, in
the reign of Theodosius II., Anthemius, then praetorian prefect
of the East and regent, enlarged and refortified the city by the
erection of the wall which forms the innermost line of defence in
the bulwarks whose picturesque ruins now stretch from the Sea
of Marmora, on the south of Yedi Kuléh (the seven towers),
northwards to the old Byzantine palace of the Porphyrogenitus
(Tekfour Serai), above the quarter of Egri Kapu. There the new
works joined the walls of the suburb of Blachernae, and thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>5</span>
protected the city on the west down to the Golden Horn. Somewhat
later, in 439, the walls along the Marmora and the Golden
Horn were brought, by the prefect Cyrus, up to the extremities
of the new landward walls, and thus invested the capital in
complete armour. Then also Constantinople attained its final
size. For any subsequent extension of the city limits was
insignificant, and was due to strategic considerations. In 447
the wall of Anthemius was seriously injured by one of those
earthquakes to which the city is liable. The disaster was all
the more grave, as the Huns under Attila were carrying everything
before them in the Balkan lands. The desperateness of
the situation, however, roused the government of Theodosius II.,
who was still upon the throne, to put forth the most energetic
efforts to meet the emergency. If we may trust two contemporary
inscriptions, one Latin, the other Greek, still found on
the gate Yeni Mevlevi Khanéh Kapusi (Porta Rhegium), the
capital was again fully armed, and rendered more secure than
ever, by the prefect Constantine, in less than two months. Not
only was the wall of Anthemius restored, but, at the distance
of 20 yds., another wall was built in front of it, and at the
same distance from this second wall a broad moat was constructed
with a breastwork along its inner edge. Each wall
was flanked by ninety-six towers. According to some authorities,
the moat was flooded during a siege by opening the aqueducts,
which crossed the moat at intervals and conveyed water into
the city in time of peace. This opinion is extremely doubtful.
But in any case, here was a barricade 190-207 ft. thick, and
100 ft. high, with its several parts rising tier above tier to permit
concerted action, and alive with large bodies of troops ready to
pour, from every coign of vantage, missiles of death&mdash;arrows,
stones, Greek fire&mdash;upon a foe. It is not strange that these
fortifications defied the assaults of barbarism upon the civilized
life of the world for more than a thousand years. As might be
expected, the walls demanded frequent restoration from time
to time in the course of their long history. Inscriptions upon
them record repairs, for example, under Justin II., Leo the
Isaurian, Basil II., John Palaeologus, and others. Still, the
ramparts extending now from the Marmora to Tekfour Serai
are to all intents and purposes the ruins of the Theodosian walls
of the 5th century.</p>

<p>This is not the case in regard to the other parts of the fortifications
of the city. The walls along the Marmora and the Golden
Horn represent the great restoration of the seaward defences
of the capital carried out by the emperor Theophilus in the 9th
century; while the walls between Tekfour Serai and the Golden
Horn were built long after the reign of Theodosius II., superseding
the defences of that quarter of the city in his day, and
relegating them, as traces of their course to the rear of the later
works indicate, to the secondary office of protecting the palace
of Blachernae. In 627 Heraclius built the wall along the west
of the quarter of Aivan Serai, in order to bring the level tract at
the foot of the 6th hill within the city bounds, and shield the
church of Blachernae, which had been exposed to great danger
during the siege of the city by the Avars in that year. In 813
Leo V. the Armenian built the wall which stands in front of the
wall of Heraclius to strengthen that point in view of an expected
attack by the Bulgarians.</p>

<p>The splendid wall, flanked by nine towers, that descends from
the court of Tekfour Serai to the level tract below Egri Kapu,
was built by Manuel Comnenus (1143-1180) for the greater
security of the part of the city in which stood the palace of
Blachernae, then the favourite imperial residence. Lastly,
the portion of the fortifications between the wall of Manuel
and the wall of Heraclius presents too many problems to be
discussed here. Enough to say, that in it we find work belonging
to the times of the Comneni, Isaac Angelus and the Palaeologi.</p>

<p>If we leave out of account the attacks upon the city in the
course of the civil wars between rival parties in the empire, the
fortifications of Constantinople were assailed by the Avars in
627; by the Saracens in 673-677, and again in 718; by the
Bulgarians in 813 and 913; by the forces of the Fourth Crusade
in 1203-1204; by the Turks in 1422 and 1453. The city was
taken in 1204, and became the seat of a Latin empire until 1261,
when it was recovered by the Greeks. On the 29th of May 1453
Constantinople ceased to be the capital of the Roman empire
in the East, and became the capital of the Ottoman dominion.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy points in the circuit of the walls of the
city are the following. (1) The Golden gate, now included in
the Turkish fortress of Yedi Kuléh. It is a triumphal archway,
consisting of three arches, erected in honour of the victory of
Theodosius I. over Maximus in 388, and subsequently incorporated
in the walls of Theodosius II., as the state entrance of the
capital. (2) The gate of Selivria, or of the Pegé, through which
Alexius Strategopoulos made his way into the city in 1261, and
brought the Latin empire of Constantinople to an end. (3) The
gate of St Romanus (Top Kapusi), by which, in 1453, Sultan
Mahommed entered Constantinople after the fall of the city
into Turkish hands. (4) The great breach made in the ramparts
crossing the valley of the Lycus, the scene of the severest
fighting in the siege of 1453, where the Turks stormed the city,
and the last Byzantine emperor met his heroic death. (5) The
palace of the Porphyrogenitus, long erroneously identified with the
palace of the Hebdomon, which really stood at Makrikeui. It is
the finest specimen of Byzantine civil architecture left in the city.
(6) The tower of Isaac Angelus and the tower of Anemas, with
the chambers in the body of the wall to the north of them. (7)
The wall of Leo, against which the troops of the Fourth Crusade
came, in 1203, from their camp on the hill opposite the wall, and
delivered their chief attack. (8) The walls protecting the quarter
of Phanar, which the army and fleet of the Fourth Crusade under
the Venetian doge Henrico Dandolo carried in 1204. (9) Yali
Kiosk Kapusi, beside which the southern end of the chain drawn
across the mouth of the harbour during a siege was attached.
(10) The ruins of the palace of Hormisdas, near Chatladi Kapu,
once the residence of Justinian the Great and Theodora. It
was known in later times as the palace of the Bucoleon, and was
the scene of the assassination of Nicephorus Phocas. (11) The
sites of the old harbours between Chatladi Kapu and Daud
Pasha Kapusi. (12) The fine marble tower near the junction
of the walls along the Marmora with the landward walls.</p>

<p>The interior arrangements of the city were largely determined
by the configuration of its site, which falls into three great divisions,&mdash;the
level ground and slopes looking towards the Sea of
Marmora, the range of hills forming the midland portion of the
promontory, and the slopes and level ground facing the Golden
Horn. In each division a great street ran through the city from
east to west, generally lined with arcades on one side, but with
arcades on both sides when traversing the finer and busier
quarters. The street along the ridge formed the principal
thoroughfare, and was named the Mesé (<span class="grk" title="Mesê">&#924;&#941;&#963;&#951;</span>), because it ran
through the middle of the city. On reaching the west of the
3rd hill, it divided into two branches, one leading across the 7th
hill to the Golden gate, the other conducting to the church of
the Holy Apostles, and the gate of Charisius (Edirnéh Kapusi).
The Mesé linked together the great fora of the city,&mdash;the Augustaion
on the south of St Sophia, the forum of Constantine on the
summit of the 2nd hill, the forum of Theodosius I. or of Taurus
on the summit of the 3rd hill, the forum of Amastrianon where the
mosque of Shah Zadéh is situated, the forum of the Bous at Ak
Serai, and the forum of Arcadius or Theodosius II. on the summit
of the 7th hill. This was the route followed on the occasion of
triumphal processions.</p>

<p>Of the edifices and monuments which adorned the fora, only a
slight sketch can be given here. On the north side of the
Augustaion rose the church of St Sophia, the most glorious
cathedral of Eastern Christendom; opposite, on the southern
side of the square, was the Chalcé, the great gate of the imperial
palace; on the east was the senate house, with a porch of six
noble columns; to the west, across the Mesé, were the law
courts. In the area of the square stood the Milion, whence distances
from Constantinople were measured, and a lofty column
which bore the equestrian statue of Justinian the Great. There
also was the statue of the empress Eudoxia, famous in the history
of Chrysostom, the pedestal of which is preserved near the church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>6</span>
of St Irené. The Augustaion was the heart of the city&rsquo;s ecclesiastical
and political life. The forum of Constantine was a great
business centre. Its most remarkable monument was the column
of Constantine, built of twelve drums of porphyry and bearing
aloft his statue. Shorn of much of its beauty, the column still
stands to proclaim the enduring influence of the foundation of
the city.</p>

<p>In the forum of Theodosius I. rose a column in his honour,
constructed on the model of the hollow columns of Trajan and
Marcus Aurelius at Rome. There also was the Anemodoulion,
a beautiful pyramidal structure, surmounted by a vane to indicate
the direction of the wind. Close to the forum, if not in it, was the
capitol, in which the university of Constantinople was established.
The most conspicuous object in the forum of the Bous
was the figure of an ox, in bronze, beside which the bodies of
criminals were sometimes burnt. Another hollow column, the
pedestal of which is now known as Avret Tash, adorned the
forum of Arcadius. A column in honour of the emperor Marcian
still stands in the valley of the Lycus, below the mosque of
Sultan Mahommed the Conqueror. Many beautiful statues,
belonging to good periods of Greek and Roman art, decorated
the fora, streets and public buildings of the city, but conflagrations
and the vandalism of the Latin and Ottoman conquerors
of Constantinople have robbed the world of those treasures.</p>

<p>The imperial palace, founded by Constantine and extended
by his successors, occupied the territory which lies to the east
of St Sophia and the Hippodrome down to the water&rsquo;s edge.
It consisted of a large number of detached buildings, in grounds
made beautiful with gardens and trees, and commanding magnificent
views over the Sea of Marmora, across to the hills and mountains
of the Asiatic coast. The buildings were mainly grouped
in three divisions&mdash;the Chalcé, the Daphné and the &ldquo;sacred
palace.&rdquo; Labarte and Paspates have attempted to reconstruct
the palace, taking as their guide the descriptions given of it by
Byzantine writers. The work of Labarte is specially valuable,
but without proper excavations of the site all attempts to
restore the plan of the palace with much accuracy lack a solid
foundation. With the accession of Alexius Comnenus, the palace
of Blachernae, at the north-western corner of the city, became
the principal residence of the Byzantine court, and was in consequence
extended and embellished. It stood in a more retired
position, and was conveniently situated for excursions into
the country and hunting expeditions. Of the palaces outside the
walls, the most frequented were the palace at the Hebdomon,
now Makrikeui, in the early days of the Empire, and the palace
of the Pegé, now Balukli, a short distance beyond the gate of
Selivria, in later times. For municipal purposes, the city was
divided, like Rome, into fourteen Regions.</p>

<p>As the seat of the chief prelate of Eastern Christendom,
Constantinople was characterized by a strong theological and
ecclesiastical temperament. It was full of churches and monasteries,
enriched with the reputed relics of saints, prophets and
martyrs, which consecrated it a holy city and attracted pilgrims
from every quarter to its shrines. It was the meeting-place of
numerous ecclesiastical councils, some of them ecumenical (see
below, <a href="#artlinks">Constantinople, Councils of</a>). It was likewise distinguished
for its numerous charitable institutions. Only some
twenty of the old churches of the city are left. Most of them have
been converted into mosques, but they are valuable monuments
of the art which flourished in New Rome. Among the most
interesting are the following. St John of the Studium (Emir-Achor
Jamissi) is a basilica of the middle of the 5th century,
and the oldest ecclesiastical fabric in the city; it is now, unfortunately,
almost a complete ruin. SS. Sergius and Bacchus
(Kutchuk Aya Sofia) and St Sophia are erections of Justinian
the Great. The former is an example of a dome placed on an
octagonal structure, and in its general plan is similar to the contemporary
church of S. Vitale at Ravenna. St Sophia (i.e.
<span class="grk" title="Hagia Sophia">&#902;&#947;&#943;&#945; &#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>, Holy Wisdom) is the glory of Byzantine art, and
one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. St Mary
Diaconissa (Kalender Jamissi) is a fine specimen of the work
of the closing years of the 6th century. St Irené, founded by
Constantine, and repaired by Justinian, is in its present form
mainly a restoration by Leo the Isaurian, in the middle of the 8th
century. St Mary Panachrantos (Fenari Isa Mesjidi) belongs
to the reign of Leo the Wise (886-912). The Myrelaion (Bodrum
Jami) dates from the 10th century. The Pantepoptes (Eski
Imaret Jamissi), the Pantocrator (Zeirek Kilissè Jamissi), and
the body of the church of the Chora (Kahriyeh Jamissi) represent
the age of the Comneni. The Pammacaristos (Fetiyeh Jamissi),
St Andrew in Krisei (Khoja Mustapha Jamissi), the narthexes and
side chapel of the Chora were, at least in their present form,
erected in the times of the Palaeologi. It is difficult to assign
precise dates to SS. Peter and Mark (Khoda Mustapha Jamissi
at Aivan Scrai), St Theodosia (Gul Jamissi), St Theodore Tyrone
(Kilissé Jamissi). The beautiful façade of the last is later than
the other portions of the church, which have been assigned
to the 9th or 10th century.</p>

<p>For the thorough study of the church of St Sophia, the reader
must consult the works of Fossati, Salzenburg, Lethaby and
Swainson, and Antoniadi. The present edifice was built by
Justinian the Great, under the direction of Anthemius of Tralles
and his nephew Isidorus of Miletus. It was founded in 532
and dedicated on Christmas Day 538. It replaced two earlier
churches of that name, the first of which was built by Constantius
and burnt down in 404, on the occasion of the exile of Chrysostom,
while the second was erected by Theodosius II. in 415, and
destroyed by fire in the Nika riot of 532. Naturally the church
has undergone repair from time to time. The original dome
fell in 558, as the result of an earthquake, and among the improvements
introduced in the course of restoration, the dome
was raised 25 ft. higher than before. Repairs are recorded under
Basil I., Basil II., Andronicus III. and Cantacuzene. Since the
Turkish conquest a minaret has been erected at each of the
four exterior angles of the building, and the interior has been
adapted to the requirements of Moslem worship, mainly by the
destruction or concealment of most of the mosaics which adorned
the walls. In 1847-1848, during the reign of Abd-ul-Mejid,
the building was put into a state of thorough repair by the Italian
architect Fossati. Happily the sultan allowed the mosaic figures,
then exposed to view, to be covered with matting before being
plastered over. They may reappear in the changes which the
future will bring.</p>

<p>The exterior appearance of the church is certainly disappointing,
but within it is, beyond all question, one of the most beautiful
creations of human art. On a large scale, and in magnificent
style, it combines the attractive features of a basilica, with all the
glory of an edifice crowned by a dome. We have here a stately
hall, 235 ft. N. and S., by 250 ft. E. and W., divided by two
piers and eight columns on either hand into nave and aisles,
with an apse at the eastern end and galleries on the three other
sides. Over the central portion of the nave, a square area at
the angles of which stand the four piers, and at a height of 179 ft.
above the floor, spreads a dome, 107 ft. in diameter, and 46
ft. deep, its base pierced by forty arched windows. From the
cornice of the dome stretches eastwards and westwards a semi-dome,
which in its turn rests upon three small semi-domes.
The nave is thus covered completely by a domical canopy,
which, in its ascent, swells larger and larger, mounts higher and
higher, as though a miniature heaven rose overhead. For lightness,
for grace, for proportion, the effect is unrivalled. The walls
of the building are reveted with marbles of various hues and
patterns, arranged to form beautiful designs, and traces of the
mosaics which joined the marbles in the rich and soft coloration
of the whole interior surface of the building appear at many
points. There are forty columns on the ground floor and sixty
in the galleries, often crowned with beautiful capitals, in which
the monograms of the emperor Justinian and the empress Theodora
are inscribed. The eight porphyry columns, placed in pairs
in the four bays at the corners of the nave, belonged originally
to the temple of the sun at Baalbek. They were subsequently
carried to Rome by Aurelian, and at length presented to Justinian
by a lady named Marcia, to be erected in this church &ldquo;for the
salvation of her soul.&rdquo; The columns of verde antique on either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>7</span>
side of the nave are commonly said to have come from the temple
of Diana at Ephesus, but recent authorities regard them as
specially cut for use in the church. The inner narthex of the
church formed a magnificent vestibule 205 ft. long by 26 ft.
wide, reveted with marble slabs and glowing with mosaics.</p>

<p>The citizens of Constantinople found their principal recreation
in the chariot-races held in the Hippodrome, now the At Meidan,
to the west of the mosque of Sultan Ahmed. So much did the
race-course (begun by Severus but completed by Constantine)
enter into the life of the people that it has been styled &ldquo;the axis
of the Byzantine world.&rdquo; It was not only the scene of amusement,
but on account of its ample accommodation it was also
the arena of much of the political life of the city. The factions,
which usually contended there in sport, often gathered there
in party strife. There emperors were acclaimed or insulted;
there military triumphs were celebrated; there criminals were
executed, and there martyrs were burned at the stake. Three
monuments remain to mark the line of the Spina, around which
the chariots whirled; an Egyptian obelisk of Thothmes III.,
on a pedestal covered with bas-reliefs representing Theodosius I.,
the empress Galla, and his sons Arcadius and Honorius, presiding
at scenes in the Hippodrome; the triple serpent column,
which stood originally at Delphi, to commemorate the victory of
Plataea 479 B.C.; a lofty pile of masonry, built in the form of
an obelisk, and once covered with plates of gilded bronze. Under
the Turkish buildings along the western side of the arena, some
arches against which seats for the spectators were built are still
visible.</p>

<p>The city was supplied with water mainly from two sources;
from the streams immediately to the west, and from the springs
and rain impounded in reservoirs in the forest of Belgrade, to
the north-west, very much on the system followed by the Turks.
The water was conveyed by aqueducts, concealed below the
surface, except when crossing a valley. Within the city the water
was stored in covered cisterns, or in large open reservoirs. The
aqueduct of Justinian, the Crooked aqueduct, in the open country,
and the aqueduct of Valens that spans the valley between the
4th and 3rd hills of the city, still carry on their beneficent work,
and afford evidence of the attention given to the water-supply
of the capital during the Byzantine period. The cistern of
Arcadius, to the rear of the mosque of Sultan Selim (having,
it has been estimated, a capacity of 6,571,720 cubic ft. of water),
the cistern of Aspar, a short distance to the east of the Gate of
Adrianople, and the cistern of Mokius, on the 7th hill, are specimens
of the open reservoirs within the city walls. The cistern
of Bin Bir Derek (cistern of Illus) with its 224 columns, each
built up with three shafts, and the cistern Yen Batan Serai
(Cisterna Basilica) with its 420 columns show what covered
cisterns were, on a grand scale. The latter is still in use.<a name="FnAnchor_1a" href="#Footnote_1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>Byzantine Constantinople was a great commercial centre.
To equip it more fully for that purpose, several artificial harbours
were constructed along the southern shore of the city, where
no natural haven existed to accommodate ships coming up the
Sea of Marmora. For the convenience of the imperial court,
there was a small harbour in the bend of the shore to the east
of Chatladi Kapu, known as the harbour of the Bucoleon. To
the west of that gate, on the site of Kadriga Limani (the Port
of the Galley), was the harbour of Julian, or, as it was named
later, the harbour of Sophia (the empress of Justin II.). Traces
of the harbour styled the Kontoscalion are found at Kum Kapu.
To the east of Yeni Kapu stood the harbour of Kaisarius or the
Heptascalon, while to the west of that gate was the harbour
which bore the names of Eleutherius and of Theodosiur I. A
harbour named after the Golden Gate stood on the shore to the
south-west of the triumphal gate of the city.</p>

<p><i>The Modern City.</i>&mdash;As the capital of the Ottoman empire,
the aspect of the city changed in many ways. The works of
art which adorned New Rome gradually disappeared. The
streets, never very wide, became narrower, and the porticoes
along their sides were almost everywhere removed. A multitude
of churches were destroyed, and most of those which survived
were converted into mosques. In race and garb and speech
the population grew largely oriental. One striking alteration
in the appearance of the city was the conversion of the territory
extending from the head of the promontory to within a short
distance of St Sophia into a great park, within which the buildings
constituting the seraglio of the sultans, like those forming the
palace of the Byzantine emperors, were ranged around three
courts, distinguished by their respective gates&mdash;Bab-i-Humayum,
leading into the court of the Janissaries; Orta Kapu, the middle
gate, giving access to the court in which the sultan held state
receptions; and Bah-i-Saadet, the Gate of Felicity, leading to
the more private apartments of the palace. From the reign of
Abd-ul-Mejid, the seraglio has been practically abandoned, first
for the palace of Dolmabagché on the shore near Beshiktash,
and now for Yildiz Kiosk, on the heights above that suburb. It
is, however, visited annually by the sultan, to do homage to the
relics of the prophet which are kept there. The older apartments
of the palace, such as the throne-room, the Bagdad Kiosk, and
many of the objects in the imperial treasury are of extreme
interest to all lovers of oriental art. To visit the seraglio, an
imperial iradé is necessary. Another great change in the general
aspect of the city has been produced by the erection of stately
mosques in the most commanding situations, where dome and
minarets and huge rectangular buildings present a combination
of mass and slenderness, of rounded lines and soaring pinnacles,
which gives to Constantinople an air of unique dignity and grace,
and at the same time invests it with the glamour of the oriental
world. The most remarkable mosques are the following:&mdash;The
mosque of Sultan Mahommed the Conqueror, built on the site
of the church of the Holy Apostles, in 1459, but rebuilt in 1768
owing to injuries due to an earthquake; the mosques of Sultan
Selim, of the Shah Zadeh, of Sultan Suleiman and of Rustem
Pasha&mdash;all works of the 16th century, the best period of Turkish
architecture; the mosque of Sultan Bayezid II. (1497-1505);
the mosque of Sultan Ahmed I. (1610); Yeni-Validé-Jamissi
(1615-1665); Nuri-Osmanieh (1748-1755); Laleli-Jamissi
(1765). The Turbehs containing the tombs of the sultans and
members of their families are often beautiful specimens of
Turkish art.</p>

<p>In their architecture, the mosques present a striking instance
of the influence of the Byzantine style, especially as it appears
in St Sophia. The architects of the mosques have made a
skilful use of the semi-dome in the support of the main dome
of the building, and in the consequent extension of the arched
canopy that spreads over the worshipper. In some cases the
main dome rests upon four semi-domes. At the same time,
when viewed from the exterior, the main dome rises large, bold
and commanding, with nothing of the squat appearance that
mars the dome of St Sophia, with nothing of the petty prettiness
of the little domes perched on the drums of the later Byzantine
churches. The great mosques express the spirit of the days
when the Ottoman empire was still mighty and ambitious.
Occasionally, as in the case of Laleli Jamissi, where the dome rests
upon an octagon inscribed in a square, the influence of SS.
Sergius and Bacchus is perceptible.</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, Constantinople is now the
collection of towns and villages situated on both sides of the
Golden Horn and along the shores of the Bosporus, including
Scutari and Kadikeui. But the principal parts of this great
agglomeration are Stamboul (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="eis tên polin">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#960;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span>, &ldquo;into
the city&rdquo;), the name specially applied to the portion of the city
upon the promontory, Galata and Pera. Galata has a long
history, which becomes of general interest after 1265, when it
was assigned to the Genoese merchants in the city by Michael
Palaeologus, in return for the friendly services of Genoa in the
overthrow of the Latin empire of Constantinople. In the course
of time, notwithstanding stipulations to the contrary, the town
was strongly fortified and proved a troublesome neighbour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>8</span>
During the siege of 1453 the inhabitants maintained on the whole
a neutral attitude, but on the fall of the capital they surrendered
to the Turkish conqueror, who granted them liberal terms. The
walls have for the most part been removed. The noble tower,
however, which formed the citadel of the colony, still remains,
and is a striking feature in the scenery of Constantinople. There
are also churches and houses dating from Genoese days. Galata
is the chief business centre of the city, the seat of banks, post-offices,
steamship offices, &amp;c. Pera is the principal residential
quarter of the European communities settled in Constantinople,
where the foreign embassies congregate, and the fashionable
shops and hotels are found.</p>

<p>Since the middle of the 19th century the city has yielded more
and more to western influences, and is fast losing its oriental
character. The sultan&rsquo;s palaces, and the residences of all classes
of the community, adopt with more or less success a European
style of building. The streets have been widened and named.
They are in many instances better paved, and are lighted at
night. The houses are numbered. Cabs and tramways have
been introduced. Public gardens have been opened. For some
distance outside the Galata bridge, both shores of the Golden
Horn have been provided with a quay at which large steamers
can moor to discharge or embark their passengers and cargo.
The Galata quay, completed in 1889, is 756 metres long and 20
metres wide; the Stamboul quay, completed in 1900, is 378
metres in length. The harbour, quays and facilities for handling
merchandise, which have been established at the head of the
Anatolian railway, at Haidar Pasha, under German auspices,
would be a credit to any city. It is true that most of these
improvements are due to foreign enterprise and serve largely
foreign interests; still they have also benefited the city, and
added much to the convenience and comfort of local life. There
has been likewise progress in other than material respects.
The growth of the imperial museum of antiquities, under the
direction of Hamdy Bey, within the grounds of the Seraglio,
has been remarkable; and while the collection of the sarcophagi
discovered at Sidon constitutes the chief treasure of the museum,
the institution has become a rich storehouse of many other
valuable relics of the past. The existence of a school of art,
where painting and architecture are taught, is also a sign of new
times. A school of handicrafts flourishes on the Sphendoné
of the Hippodrome. The fine medical school between Scutari
and Haidar Pasha, the Hamidieh hospital for children, and the
asylum for the poor, tell of the advance of science and humanity
in the place.</p>

<p>Considerable attention is now given to the subject of education
throughout the empire, a result due in great measure to the
influence of the American and French schools and colleges
established in the provinces and at the capital. More than
thirty foreign educational institutions flourish in Constantinople
itself, and they are largely attended by the youth belonging to
the native communities of the country. The Greek population
is provided with excellent schools and gymnasia, and the
Armenians also maintain schools of a high grade. The Turkish
government itself became, moreover, impressed with the importance
of education, and as a consequence the whole system of
public instruction for the Moslem portion of the population was,
during the reign of Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid II., more widely
extended and improved. Beside the schools of the old type
attached to the mosques, schools of a better class were established
under the direct control of the minister of education,
which, although open to improvement, certainly aimed at a
higher standard than that reached in former days. The progress
of education became noticeable even among Moslem girls. The
social and political influence of this intellectual improvement
among the various communities of the empire soon made itself
felt, and had much to do with the startling success of the constitutional
revolution carried out, under the direction of the
Committee of Union and Progress, in the autumn of 1908.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate of the city is healthy, but relaxing.
It is damp and liable to sudden and great changes of temperature.
The winds from the north and those from the south are at
constant feud, and blow cold or hot in the most capricious
manner, often in the course of the same day. &ldquo;There are two
climates at Constantinople, that of the north and that of the
south wind.&rdquo; The winters may be severe, but when mild they
are wet and not invigorating. In summer the heat is tempered
by the prevalence of a north-east wind that blows down the
channel of the Bosporus. Observations at Constantinople and
at Scutari give the following results, for a period of twenty years.</p>

<p>The sanitation of the city has been improved, although much
remains to be done in that respect. No great epidemic has visited
the city since the outbreak of cholera in 1866. Typhoid and
pulmonary diseases are common.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The number of the population of the city is an
uncertain figure, as no accurate statistics can be obtained. It
is generally estimated between 800,000 and 1,000,000. The
inhabitants present a remarkable conglomeration of different
races, various nationalities, divers languages, distinctive
costumes and conflicting faiths, giving, it is true, a singular
interest to what may be termed the human scenery of the city,
but rendering impossible any close social cohesion, or the development
of a common civic life. Constantinople has well been
described as &ldquo;a city not of one nation but of many, and hardly
more of one than of another.&rdquo; The following figures are given
as an approximate estimate of the size of the communities
which compose the population.</p>

<p><i>Water-Supply.</i>&mdash;Under the rule of the sultans, the water-supply
of the city has been greatly extended. The reservoirs
in the forest of Belgrade have been enlarged and increased in
number, and new aqueducts have been added to those erected
by the Byzantine emperors. The use of the old cisterns within
the walls has been almost entirely abandoned, and the water is
led to basins in vaulted chambers (<i>Taxim</i>), from which it is
distributed by underground conduits to the fountains situated
in the different quarters of the city. From these fountains the
water is taken to a house by water-carriers, or, in the case of the
humbler classes, by members of the household itself.</p>

<p>For the supply of Pera, Galata and Beshiktash, Sultan
Mahmud I. constructed, in 1732, four bends in the forest of
Belgrade, N.N.W. and N.E. of the village of Bagchekeui, and
the fine aqueduct which spans the head of the valley of Buyukderé.
Since 1885, a French company, La Compagnie des Eaux,
has rendered a great service by bringing water to Stamboul,
Pera, and the villages on the European side of the Bosporus,
from Lake Dercos, which lies close to the shore of the Black Sea
some 29 m. distant from the city. The Dercos water is laid
on in many houses. Since 1893 a German company has supplied
Scutari and Kadikeui with water from the valley of the Sweet
Waters of Asia.</p>

<p><i>Trade.</i>&mdash;The trade of the city has been unfavourably affected
by the political events which have converted former provinces
of the Turkish empire into autonomous states, by the development
of business at other ports of the empire, owing to the
opening up of the interior country through the construction of
railroads, and by the difficulties which the government, with
the view of preventing political agitation, has put in the way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>9</span>
easy intercourse by natives between the capital and the provinces.
Most of the commerce of the city is in hands of foreigners and of
Armenian and Greek merchants. Turks have little if anything
to do with trade on a large scale. &ldquo;The capital,&rdquo; says a writer
in the <i>Konstantinopler Handelsblatt</i> of November 1904, &ldquo;produces
very little for export, and its hinterland is small, extending
on the European side only a few kilometres&mdash;the outlet for the
fertile Eastern Rumelia is Dedeagach&mdash;and on the Asiatic side
embracing the Sea of Marmora and the Anatolian railway
district. Even part of this will be lost to Constantinople when
the Anatolian railway is connected with the port of Mersina
and with the Kassaba-Smyrna railway. Some 750 tons of the
sweetmeat known as &rsquo;Turkish delight&rsquo; are annually exported
to the United Kingdom, America and Rumelia; embroideries,
&amp;c., are sold in fair quantities to tourists. Otherwise the chief
articles of Constantinople&rsquo;s export trade consist of refuse and
waste materials, sheep&rsquo;s wool (called <i>Kassab bashí</i>) and skins
from the slaughter-houses (in 1903 about 3,000,000 skins were
exported, mostly to America), horns, hoofs, goat and horse hair,
guts, bones, rags, bran, old iron, &amp;c., and finally dogs&rsquo; excrements,
called in trade &rsquo;pure,&rsquo; a Constantinople speciality, which
is used in preparing leather for ladies&rsquo; gloves. From the hinterland
comes mostly raw produce such as grain, drugs, wool, silk,
ores and also carpets. The chief article is grain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The average value of the goods passing through the port of
Constantinople at the opening of the 20th century was estimated
at about £T 11,000,000. From the imperfect statistics available,
the following tables of the class of goods imported and exported,
and their respective values, were drawn up in 1901 by the late
Mr Whittaker, <i>The Times</i> correspondent.</p>

<p>About 40% of the import trade of Constantinople is British.
According to the trade report of the British consulate, the share
of the United Kingdom in the value of £7,142,000 on the total
imports to Constantinople during the year 1900-1901 was
£1,811,000; while the share of the United Kingdom in the
value of £2,669,000 on the total exports during the same year
was £998,000. But it is worthy of note that while British
commerce still led the way in Turkey, the trade of some other
countries with Turkey, especially that of Germany, was increasing
more rapidly. Comparing the average of the period 1896-1900
with the total for 1904, British trade showed an increase
of 33%, Austro-Hungarian of nearly 60%, Germany of 130%,
Italian of 98%, French of 8%, and Belgian of nearly 33%.
The shipping visiting the port of Constantinople during the year
1905, excluding sailing and small coasting vessels, was 9796,
representing a total of 14,785,080 tons. The percentage of
steamers under the British flag was 37.1; of tonnage, 45.9.</p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;For the preservation of order and security,
the city is divided into four divisions (Belad-i-Selassi), viz.
Stamboul, Pera-Galata, Beshiktash and Scutari. The minister
of police is at the head of the administration of the affairs of
these divisions, and is <i>ex-officio</i> governor of Stamboul. The
governors of the other divisions are subordinate to him, but are
appointed by the sultan. Each governor has a special staff of
police and gendarmery and his own police-court. In each division
is a military commander, having a part of the garrison of the
city under his orders, but subordinate to the commander-in-chief
of the troops guarding the capital.</p>

<p>The municipal government of the four divisions of the city
is in the hands of a prefect, appointed by the sultan, and subordinate
to the minister of the interior. He is officially styled
the prefect of Stamboul, and is assisted by a council of twenty-four
members, appointed by the sultan or the minister of the interior.
All matters concerning the streets, the markets, the bazaars,
the street-porters (<i>hamals</i>), public weighers, baths and hospitals
come under his jurisdiction. He is charged also with the collection
of the city dues, and the taxes on property. The city is
furthermore divided into ten municipal circles as follows. In
Stamboul: (1) Sultan Bayezid, (2) Sultan Mehemet, (3) Djerah
Pasha (Psamatia); on the European side of the Bosporus and
the northern side of the Golden Horn: (4) Beshiktash, (5)
Yenikeui, (6) Pera, (7) Buyukderé; on the Asiatic side of the Bosporus:
(8) Anadol Hissar, (9) Scutari, (10) Kadikeui. Each
circle is subdivided into several wards (<i>mahalleh</i>). &ldquo;The outlying
parts of the city are divided into six districts (<i>Cazas</i>),
namely, Princes&rsquo; Islands, Guebzeh, Beicos, Kartal, Kuchuk-Chekmedjé
and Shilé, each having its governor (<i>kaimakam</i>),
who is usually chosen by the palace. These districts are dependencies
of the ministry of the interior, and their municipal affairs
are directed by agents of the prefecture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In virtue of old treaties, known as the <a href="#artlinks">Capitulations</a> (q.v.),
foreigners enjoy to a large extent the rights of exterritoriality.
In disputes with one another, they are judged before their own
courts of justice. In litigation between a foreigner and a native,
the case is taken to a native court, but a representative of the
foreigner&rsquo;s consulate attends the proceedings. Foreigners have
a right to establish their own schools and hospitals, to hold their
special religious services, and even to maintain their respective
national post-offices. No Turkish policeman may enter the
premises of a foreigner without the sanction of the consular
authorities to whose jurisdiction the latter belongs. A certain
measure of self-government is likewise granted to the native
Christian communities under their ecclesiastical chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONSTANTINOPLE, COUNCILS OF.</span> Of the numerous ecclesiastical
councils held at Constantinople the most important are
the following:</p>

<p>1. The second ecumenical council, 381, which was in reality
only a synod of bishops from Thrace, Asia and Syria, convened
by Theodosius with a view to uniting the church upon the basis
of the Orthodox faith. No Western bishop was present, nor any
Roman legate; from Egypt came only a few bishops, and these
tardily. The first president was Meletius of Antioch, whom
Rome regarded as schismatic. Yet, despite its sectional character,
the council came in time to be regarded as ecumenical
alike in the West and in the East.</p>

<p>The council reaffirmed the Nicene faith and denounced all
opposing doctrines. The so-called &ldquo;Niceno-Constantinopolitan
Creed,&rdquo; which has almost universally been ascribed to this
council, is certainly not the Nicene creed nor even a recension
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>10</span>
of it, but most likely a Jerusalem baptismal formula revised by
the interpolation of a few Nicene test-words. More recently
its claim to be called &ldquo;Constantinopolitan&rdquo; has been challenged.
It is not found in the earliest records of the acts of the council,
nor was it referred to by the council of Ephesus (431), nor by
the &ldquo;Robber Synod&rdquo; (449), although these both confirmed
the Nicene faith. It also lacks the definiteness one would expect
in a creed composed by an anti-Arian, anti-Pneumatomachian
council. Harnack (Herzog-Hauck, <i>Realencyklopädie</i>, 3rd ed.,
s.v. &ldquo;Konstantinopolit. Symbol.&rdquo;) conjectures that it was
ascribed to the council of Constantinople just before the council
of Chalcedon in order to prove the orthodoxy of the Fathers of
the second ecumenical council. At all events, it became the
creed of the universal church, and has been retained without
change. Save for the addition of <i>filioque</i>.</p>

<p>Of the seven reputed canons of the council only the first four
are unquestionably genuine. The fifth and the sixth probably
belong to a synod of 382, and the seventh is properly not a canon.
The most important enactments of the council were the granting
of metropolitan rights to the bishops of Alexandria, Antioch,
Thrace, Pontus and Ephesus; and according to Constantinople
the place of honour after Rome, against which Rome protested.
Not until 150 years later, and then only under compulsion of the
emperor Justinian, did Rome acknowledge the ecumenicity of
the council, and that merely as regarded its doctrinal decrees.</p>

<i>Two Dissertations</i> (Cambridge, 1876); and the article <a href="#artlinks">Creeds</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>2. The council of 553, the fifth ecumenical, grew out of the
controversy of the &ldquo;Three Chapters,&rdquo; an adequate account of
which, up to the time of the council, may be found in the articles
<span class="sc">Justinian</span> and <span class="sc">Vigilius</span>. The council convened, in response
to the imperial summons, on the 4th of May 553. Of the 165
bishops who subscribed the acts all but the five or six from
Egypt were Oriental; the pope, Vigilius, refused to attend
(he had made his escape from Constantinople, and from his
retreat in Chalcedon sent forth a vain protest against the council).
The synod was utterly subservient to the emperor. The &ldquo;Three
Chapters&rdquo; were condemned, and their authors, long dead,
anathematized, without, however, derogating from the authority
of the council of Chalcedon, which had given them a clean bill
of orthodoxy. Vigilius was excommunicated, and his name
erased from the diptychs. The Orthodox faith was set forth in
fourteen anathemas. Opinion is divided as to whether Origen
was condemned. His name occurs in the eleventh anathema,
but some consider it an interpolation; Hefele defends the
genuineness of the text, but finds no evidence for a special
session against Origen, as some have conjectured.</p>

<p>The council was confirmed by the emperor, and was generally
received in the East. Vigilius was soon coerced into submission,
but the West repudiated his pusillanimous surrender, and rejected
the council. A schism ensued which lasted half a century and
was not fully healed until the synod of Aquileia, about 700.
But the ecumenicity of the council was generally acknowledged
by 680.</p>

<p>3. The sixth ecumenical council, 680-681, which was convened
by the emperor Constantine Pogonatus to terminate the Monothelitic
controversy (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monothelites</a></span>). All the patriarchates
were represented, Constantinople and Antioch by their bishops in
person, the others by legates. The number of bishops present
varied from 150 to 300. The council approved the first five
ecumenical councils and reaffirmed the Nicene and &ldquo;Niceno-Constantinopolitan&rdquo;
creeds. Monothelitism was unequivocally
condemned; Christ was declared to have had &ldquo;two natural
wills and two natural operations, without division, conversion,
separation or confusion.&rdquo; Prominent Monothelites, living or
dead, were anathematized, in particular Sergius and his successors
in the see of Constantinople, the former pope, Honorius,
and Macarius, the patriarch of Antioch. An imperial decree
confirmed the council, and commanded the acceptance of its
doctrines under pain of severe punishment. The Monothelites
took fright and fled to Syria, where they gradually formed the
sect of the <a href="#artlinks">Maronites</a> (q.v.).</p>

<p>The anathematizing of Honorius as heterodox has occasioned
no slight embarrassment to the supporters of the doctrine of
papal infallibility. It is not within the scope of this article to
pass judgment upon the various proposed solutions of the
difficulty, e.g. that Honorius was not really a Monothelite;
that in acknowledging one will he was not speaking <i>ex cathedra</i>;
that, at the time of condemning him, the council was no longer
ecumenical; &amp;c. One thing is certain, however, he was anathematized;
and the notion of interpolation in the acts of the council
(Baronius) may be dismissed as groundless.</p>

<p>4. The &ldquo;Quinisext Synod&rdquo; (692), so-called because it was
regarded by the Greeks as supplementing the fifth and sixth
ecumenical councils, was held in the dome of the Imperial
Palace (&ldquo;In Trullo,&rdquo; whence the synod is called also &ldquo;Trullan&rdquo;).
Its work was purely legislative and its decisions were set forth
in 102 canons. The sole authoritative standards of discipline
were declared to be the &ldquo;eighty-five apostolic canons,&rdquo; the
canons of the first four ecumenical councils and of the synods
of Ancyra, Neo-Caesarea, Antioch, Changra, Laodicea, Sardica
and Carthage, and the canonical writings of some twelve Fathers,&mdash;all
canons, synods and Fathers, Eastern with one exception,
viz. Cyprian and the synod of Carthage; the bishops of Rome
and the occidental synods were utterly ignored.</p>

<p>The canons of the second and fourth ecumenical councils
respecting the rank of Constantinople were confirmed; the rank
of a see was declared to follow the civil rank of its city; unenthroned
bishops were guaranteed against diminution of their
rights; metropolitans were forbidden to alienate the property
of vacant suffragan sees.</p>

<p>The provisions respecting clerical marriage were avowedly
more lenient than the Roman practice. Ordination was denied
to any one who after baptism had contracted a second marriage,
kept a concubine, or married a widow or a woman of ill-repute.
Lectors and cantors might marry after ordination; presbyters,
deacons and sub-deacons, if already married, should retain their
wives; a bishop, however, while not dissolving his marriage,
should keep his wife at a distance, making suitable provision for
her. An illegally married cleric could not perform sacerdotal
functions. Monks and nuns were to be carefully separated, and
were not to leave their houses without permission.</p>

<p>It was forbidden to celebrate baptism or the eucharist in
private oratories; neither might laymen give the elements to
themselves, nor approach the altar, nor teach. Offerings for the
dead were authorized, and the mixed chalice made obligatory.
Contrary to the occidental custom, fasting on Saturday was
forbidden. The mutilation of the Scriptures and the desecration
of sacred places were severely condemned; likewise the use of
the lamb as the symbol for Christ (a favourite symbol in the
West).</p>

<p>The synod legislated also concerning marriage, bigamy,
adultery, rape, abortion, seductive arts and obscenity. The
theatre, the circus and gambling were unsparingly denounced,
and soothsayers and jugglers, pagan festivals and customs, and
pagan oaths were placed under the ban.</p>

<p>The council was confirmed by the emperor and accepted in
the East; but the pope protested against various canons,
chiefly those respecting the rank of Constantinople, clerical
marriage, the Saturday fast, and the use of the symbol of lamb;
and refused, despite express imperial command and threat, to
accept the &ldquo;Pseudo-Sexta.&rdquo; So that while the synod adopted
a body of legislation that has continued to be authoritative
for the Eastern Church, it did so at the cost of aggravating the
irritation of the West, and by so much hastening the inevitable
rupture of the church.</p>

Photius as an usurper and restored Ignatius to the see of Constantinople;
the latter, which the Greeks consider to have been the
true eighth ecumenical council, held after the death of Ignatius
and the reconciliation of Photius with the emperor, repudiated
the synod of 869, restored Photius, and condemned all who would
not recognize him. (For further details of these two synods see

<p><span class="bold">CONSTANTIUS, FLAVIUS VALERIUS,</span> commonly called
<span class="sc">Chlorus</span> (the Pale), an epithet due to the Byzantine historians,
Roman emperor and father of Constantine the Great, was born
about A.D. 250. He was of Illyrian origin; a fictitious connexion
with the family of Claudius Gothicus was attributed to him
by Constantine. Having distinguished himself by his military
ability and his able and gentle rule of Dalmatia, he was, on the
1st of March 293, adopted and appointed Caesar by Maximian,
whose step-daughter, Flavia Maximiana Theodora, he had
married in 289 after renouncing his wife Helena (the mother of
Constantine). In the distribution of the provinces Gaul and
Britain were allotted to Constantius. In Britain Carausius and
subsequently Allectus had declared themselves independent,
and it was not till 296 that, by the defeat of Allectus, it was
re-united with the empire. In 298 Constantius overthrew the
Alamanni in the territory of the Lingones (Langres) and
strengthened the Rhine frontier. During the persecution of the
Christians in 303 he behaved with great humanity. He obtained
the title of Augustus on the 1st of May 305, and died
the following year shortly before the 25th of July at Eboracum
(York) during an expedition against the Picts and Scots.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONSTANTZA</span> (<i>Constanta</i>), formerly known as Kustendji or
Kustendje, a seaport on the Black Sea, and capital of the
department of Constantza, Rumania; 140 m. E. by S. from
Bucharest by rail. Pop. (1900) 12,725. When the Dobrudja was
ceded to Rumania in 1878, Constantza was partly rebuilt. In its
clean and broad streets there are many synagogues, mosques and
churches, for half the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, Moslems,
Armenians or Jews; the remainder being Orthodox Rumans
and Greeks. In the vicinity there are mineral springs, and the
sea-bathing also attracts many visitors in summer. The chief
local industries are tanning and the manufacture of petroleum
drums. The opening, in 1895, of the railway to Bucharest,
which crosses the Danube by a bridge at Cerna Voda, brought
Constantza a considerable transit trade in grain and petroleum,
which are largely exported; coal and coke head the list of imports,
followed by machinery, iron goods, and cotton and woollen
fabrics. The harbour, protected by breakwaters, with a lighthouse
at the entrance, is well defended from the north winds,
but those from the south, south-east, and south-west prove
sometimes highly dangerous. In 1902 it afforded 10 alongside
berths for shipping. It had a depth of 22 ft. in the old or inner
basin, and of 26 ft. in the new or outer basin, beside the quays.
The railway runs along the quays. A weekly service between
Constantza and Constantinople is conducted by state-owned
steamers, including the fast mail and passenger boats in connexion
with the Ostend and Orient expresses. In 1902, 576 vessels
entered at Constantza, with a net registered tonnage of 641,737.
The Black Sea squadron of the Rumanian fleet is stationed here.</p>

<p>Constantza is the Constantiana which was founded in honour
of Constantia, sister of Constantine the Great (A.D. 274-337).
It lies at the seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan, and
has evidently been surrounded by fortifications of its own. In
spite of damage done by railway contractors (see Henry C.
Barkley, <i>Between the Danube and the Black Sea</i>, 1876) there are
considerable remains of ancient masonry&mdash;walls, pillars, &amp;c.
A number of inscriptions found in the town and its vicinity
show that close by was Tomi, where the Roman poet Ovid
(43 B.C.-A.D. 17) spent his last eight years in exile. A statue
of Ovid stands in the main square of Constantza.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONSTELLATION</span> (from the Lat. <i>constellatus</i>, studded with
stars; <i>con</i>, with, and <i>stella</i>, a star), in astronomy, the name given
to certain groupings of stars. The partition of the stellar expanse
into areas characterized by specified stars can be traced back
to a very remote antiquity. It is believed that the ultimate
origin of the constellation figures and names is to be found in
the corresponding systems in vogue among the primitive civilizations
of the Euphrates valley&mdash;the Sumerians, Accadians and
Babylonians; that these were carried westward into ancient
Greece by the Phoenicians, and to the lands of Asia Minor by
the Hittites, and that Hellenic culture in its turn introduced
them into Arabia, Persia and India. From the earliest times
the star-groups known as constellations, the smaller groups
(parts of constellations) known as asterisms, and also individual
stars, have received names connoting some meteorological
phenomena, or symbolizing religious or mythological beliefs.
At one time it was held that the constellation names and myths
were of Greek origin; this view has now been disproved, and
an examination of the Hellenic myths associated with the stars
and star-groups in the light of the records revealed by the
decipherment of Euphratean cuneiforms leads to the conclusion
that in many, if not all, cases the Greek myth has a Euphratean
parallel, and so renders it probable that the Greek constellation
system and the cognate legends are primarily of Semitic or
even pre-Semitic origin.</p>

<p>The origin and development of the grouping of the stars into
constellations is more a matter of archaeological than of astronomical
interest. It demands a careful study of the myths and
religious thought of primitive peoples; and the tracing of the
names from one language to another belongs to comparative
philology.</p>

<p>The Sumerians and Accadians, the non-Semitic inhabitants
of the Euphrates valley prior to the Babylonians, described
the stars collectively as a &ldquo;heavenly flock&rdquo;; the sun was the
&ldquo;old sheep&rdquo;; the seven planets were the &ldquo;old-sheep stars&rdquo;;
the whole of the stars had certain &ldquo;shepherds,&rdquo; and <i>Sibzianna</i>
(which, according to Sayce and Bosanquet, is the modern
Arcturus, the brightest star in the northern sky) was the &ldquo;star
of the shepherds of the heavenly herds.&rdquo; The Accadians
bequeathed their system to the Babylonians, and cuneiform
tablets and cylinders, boundary stones, and Euphratean art
generally, point to the existence of a well-defined system of
star names in their early history. From a detailed study of such
records, in their nature of rather speculative value, R. Brown,
junr. (<i>Primitive Constellations</i>, 1899) has compiled a Euphratean
planisphere, which he regards as the mother of all others. The
tablets examined range in date from 3000-500 B.C., and hence
the system must be anterior to the earlier date. Of great importance
is the <i>Creation Legend</i>, a cuneiform compiled from
older records during the reign of Assur-bani-pal, c. 650 B.C.,
in which there occurs a passage interpretable as pointing to
the acceptance of 36 constellations: 12 northern, 12 zodiacal
and 12 southern. These constellations were arranged in three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>12</span>
concentric annuli, the northern ones in an inner annulus subdivided
into 60 degrees, the zodiacal ones into a medial annulus of
120 degrees, and the southern ones into an outer annulus of 240
degrees. Brown has suggested a correlation of the Euphratean
names with those of the Greeks and moderns. His results may
be exhibited in the following form:&mdash;the central line gives the
modern equivalents of the names in the Euphratean zodiac; the
upper line the modern equivalents of the northern paranatellons;
and the lower line those of the southern paranatellons. The
zodiacal constellations have an interest peculiarly their own;
placed in or about the plane of the ecliptic, their rising and
setting with the sun was observed with relation to weather
changes and the more general subject of chronology, the twelve
subdivisions of the year being correlated with the twelve divisions
of the ecliptic (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Zodiac</a></span>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Phoenicians&mdash;a race dominated by the spirit of commercial
enterprise&mdash;appear to have studied the stars more
especially with respect to their service to navigators; according
to Homer &ldquo;the stars were sent by Zeus as portents for mariners.&rdquo;
But all their truly astronomical writings are lost, and only by a
somewhat speculative piecing together of scattered evidences can
an estimate of their knowledge be formed. The inter-relations
of the Phoenicians with the early Hellenes were frequent and far-reaching,
and in the Greek presentation of the legends concerning
constellations a distinct Phoenician, and in turn Euphratean,
element appears. One of the earliest examples of Greek literature
extant, the <i>Theogonia</i> of Hesiod (c. 800 B.C.), appears to be a
curious blending of Hellenic and Phoenician thought. Although
not an astronomical work, several constellation subjects are
introduced. In the same author&rsquo;s <i>Works and Days</i>, a treatise
which is a sort of shepherd&rsquo;s calendar, there are distinct references
to the Pleiades, Hyades, Orion, Sirius and Arcturus. It cannot
be argued, however, that these were the only stars and constellations
named in his time; the omission proves nothing. The
same is true of the Homeric epics wherein the Pleiades, Hyades,
Ursa major, Orion and Boötes are mentioned, and also of the
stars and constellations mentioned in Job. Further support is
given to the view that, in the main, the constellations were transmitted
to the Greeks by the Phoenicians from Euphratean
sources in the fact that Thales, the earliest Greek astronomer
of any note, was of Phoenician descent. According to Callimachus
he taught the Greeks to steer by Ursa minor instead of
Ursa major; and other astronomical observations are assigned
to him. But his writings are lost, as is also the case with those of
Phocus the Samian, and the history of astronomy by Eudemus,
the pupil of Aristotle; hence the paucity of our knowledge of
Thales&rsquo;s astronomical learning.</p>

<p>From the 6th century B.C. onwards, legends concerning the
constellation subjects were frequently treated by the historians
and poets. Aglaosthenes or Agaosthenes, an early writer, knew
Ursa minor as <span class="grk" title="Kynosoura">&#922;&#965;&#957;&#972;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>, Cynosura, and recorded the translation
of Aquila; Epimenides the Cretan (c. 600 B.C.) recorded the
translation of Capricornus and the star Capella; Pherecydes
of Athens (c. 500-450 B.C.) recorded the legend of Orion, and
stated the astronomical fact that when Orion sets Scorpio rises;
Aeschylus (525-456 B.C.) and Hellanicus of Mytilene (c. 496-411
B.C.) narrate the legend of the seven Pleiades&mdash;the daughters of
Atlas; and the latter states that the Hyades are named either
from their orientation, which resembles &upsilon; (upsilon), &ldquo;or because
at their rising or setting Zeus rains&rdquo;; and Hecataeus of Miletus
(c. 470 B.C.) treated the legend of the Hydra.</p>

<p>In the 5th century B.C. the Athenian astronomer Euctemon,
according to Geminus of Rhodes, compiled a weather calendar
in which Aquarius, Aquila, Canis major, Corona, Cygnus,
Delphinus, Lyra, Orion, Pegasus, Sagitta and the asterisms
Hyades and Pleiades are mentioned, always, however, in relation
to weather changes. The earliest Greek work which
purported to treat the constellations <i>qua</i> constellations, of which
we have certain knowledge, is the <span class="grk" title="Phainomena">&#934;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span> of Eudoxus of Cnidus
(c. 403-350 B.C.). The original is lost, but a versification by
Aratus (c. 270 B.C.), a poet at the court of Antigonus Gonatas,
king of Macedonia, and an <span class="grk" title="Exêgêsis">&#904;&#958;&#942;&#947;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> or commentary by Hipparchus,
are extant. In the <span class="grk" title="Phainomena">&#934;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span> of Aratus 44 constellations
are enumerated, viz. 19 northern:&mdash;Ursa major, Ursa minor,
Boötes, Draco, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Andromeda, Perseus,
Triangulum, Pegasus, Delphinus, Auriga, Hercules, Lyra,
Cygnus, Aquila, Sagitta, Corona and Serpentarius; 13 central
or zodiacal:&mdash;Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra,
Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces and the
Pleiades; and 12 southern:&mdash;Orion, Canis, Lepus, Argo, Cetus,
Eridanus, Piscis australis, Ara, Centaurus, Hydra, Crater and
Corvus. In this enumeration Serpens is included in Serpentarius
and Lupus in Centaurus; these two constellations were separated
by Hipparchus and, later, by Ptolemy. On the other hand,
Aratus kept the Pleiades distinct from Taurus, but Hipparchus
reduced these stars to an asterism. Aratus was no astronomer,
while Hipparchus was; and from the fact that the latter adopted,
with but trifling exceptions, the constellation system portrayed
by Aratus, it may be concluded that the system was already
familiar in Greek thought. And three hundred years after
Hipparchus, the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy adopted a
very similar scheme in his uranometria, which appears in the
seventh and eighth books of his <i>Almagest</i>, the catalogue being
styled the <span class="grk" title="Ekthesis kanonikê">&#917;&#954;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span> or &ldquo;accepted version.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Almagest</i> has a dual interest: first, being the work of one
primarily a commentator, it presents a crystallized epitome of
all earlier knowledge; and secondly, it has served as a basis of
subsequent star-catalogues.<a name="FnAnchor_1b" href="#Footnote_1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The Ptolemaic catalogue embraces
only those stars which were visible at Rhodes in the time
of Hipparchus (c. 150 B.C.), the results being corrected for
precession &ldquo;by increasing the longitudes by 2° 40&rsquo;, and leaving
the latitudes undisturbed&rdquo; (Francis Baily, <i>Mem. R.A.S.</i>, 1843).
The names and orientation of the constellations therein adopted
are, with but few exceptions, identical with those used at the
present day; and as it cannot be doubted that Ptolemy made
only very few modifications in the system of Hipparchus, the
names were adopted at least three centuries before the <i>Almagest</i>
was compiled. The names in which Ptolemy differs from
modern usage are:&mdash;Hercules (<span class="grk" title="en gonasin">&#7952;&#957; &#947;&#972;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span>), Cygnus (<span class="grk" title="Hornis">&#908;&#961;&#957;&#953;&#962;</span>),
Eridanus (<span class="grk" title="Potamos">&#928;&#972;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>), Lupus (<span class="grk" title="Thêrion">&#920;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#957;</span>), Pegasus (<span class="grk" title="Hippos">&#906;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>), Equuleus
(<span class="grk" title="Hippou protomê">&#906;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#965; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#942;</span>), Canis minor (<span class="grk" title="Prokyôn">&#928;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#973;&#969;&#957;</span>), and Libra (<span class="grk" title="Chêlai">&#935;&#951;&#955;&#945;&#943;</span>),
although <span class="grk" title="zygos">&#958;&#965;&#947;&#972;&#962;</span> is used for the same constellation in other parts
of the <i>Almagest</i>). The following table gives the names of the
constellations as they occur in (1) modern catalogues; (2)
Ptolemy (A.D. 150); (3) Ulugh Beg (1437); (4) Tycho Brahe
(1628); the last column gives the English equivalent of the
modern name.</p>

<p>The reverence and authority which was accorded the famous
compilation of the Alexandrian astronomer is well evidenced by
the catalogue of the Tatar Ulugh Beg, the Arabian names there
adopted being equivalent to the Ptolemaic names in nearly
every case; this is also shown in the Latin translations given
below. Tycho Brahe, when compiling his catalogue of stars,
was unable to observe Lupus, Ara, Corona australis and Piscis
australis, on account of the latitude of Uranienburg; and hence
these constellations are omitted from his catalogue. He diverged
from Ptolemy when he placed the asterisms Coma Berenices and
Antinous upon the level of formal constellations, Ptolemy having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>13</span>
regarded these asterisms as unformed stars (<span class="grk" title="amorphôtoi">&#7936;&#956;&#972;&#961;&#966;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span>). The
next innovator of moment was Johann Bayer, a German astronomer,
who published a <i>Uranometria</i> in 1603, in which twelve
constellations, all in the southern hemisphere, were added to
Ptolemy&rsquo;s forty-eight, viz. Apis (or Musca) (Bee), Avis Indica
(Bird of Paradise), Chameleon, Dorado (Sword-fish), Grus
(Crane), Hydrus (Water-snake), Indus (Indian), Pavo (Peacock),
Phoenix, Piscis volans (Flying fish), Toucan, Triangulum
australe. According to W. Lynn (<i>Observatory</i>, 1886, p. 255),
Bayer adapted this part of his catalogue from the observations
of the Dutch navigator Petrus Theodori (or Pieter Dirchsz
Keyser), who died in 1596 off Java. The <i>Coelum stellatum
Christianum</i> of Julius Schiller (1627) is noteworthy for the
attempt made to replace the names connoting mythological and
pagan ideas by the names of apostles, saints, popes, bishops, and
other dignitaries of the church, &amp;c. Aries became St Peter;
Taurus, St Andrew; Andromeda, the Holy Sepulchre; Lyra,
the Manger; Canis major, David; and so on. This innovation
(with which the introduction of the twelve apostles into the solar
zodiac by the Venerable Bede may be compared) was shortlived.
According to Charles Hutton [<i>Math. Dict.</i> i. 328 (1795)]
the editions published in 1654 and 1661 had reverted to the
Greek names; on the other hand, Camille Flammarion (<i>Popular
Astronomy</i>, p. 375) quotes an illuminated folio of 1661, which
represents &ldquo;the sky delivered from pagans and peopled with
Christians.&rdquo; A similar confusion was attempted by E. Weigelius,
who sought to introduce a <i>Coelum heraldicum</i>, in which the
constellations were figured as the arms or insignia of European
dynasties, and by symbols of commerce.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Edmund Halley&rsquo;s southern catalogue (<i>Catalogus stellarum
australium</i>), published in 1679 and incorporated in Flamsteed&rsquo;s
<i>Historia coelestis</i> (1725), the following constellations are
named:&mdash;Piscis australis, Columba Noachi, Argo navis, Robur
Caroli, Ara, Corona australis, Grus, Phoenix, Pavo, Apus or Avis
Indica, Musca apis, Chameleon, Triangulum australe, Piscis
volans, Dorado or Xiphias, Toucan or Anser Americanus, and
Hydrus. Flamsteed&rsquo;s maps also contained Mons Menelai.
This list contains nothing new except Robur Caroli, since
Columba Noachi (Noah&rsquo;s dove) had been raised to the skies by
Bartschius in 1624. The constellation Robur Caroli and also
the star Cor Caroli (&alpha; Canum Venaticorum) were named by
Halley in honour of Charles II. of England.</p>

<p>In 1690 two posthumous works of Johann Hevelius (1611-1687),
the <i>Firmamentum sobiescianum</i> and <i>Prodromus astronomiae</i>,
added several new constellations to the list, viz. Canes
venatici (the Greyhounds), Lacerta (the Lizard), Leo minor
(Little Lion), Lynx, Sextans Uraniae, Scutum or Clypeus
Sobieskii (the shield of Sobieski), Vulpecula et Anser (Fox and
Goose), Cerberus, Camelopardus (Giraffe), and Monoceros
(Unicorn); the last two were originally due to Jacobus Bartschius.
In 1679 Augustine Royer introduced the most interesting
of the constellations of the southern hemisphere, the Crux
australis or Southern Cross. He also suggested Nubes major,
Nubes minor, and Lilium, and re-named Canes venatici the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>14</span>
Jordan, and Vulpecula et Anser the river Tigris, but these
innovations met with no approval. The Magellanic clouds, a
collection of nebulae, stars and star-clusters in the neighbourhood
of the south pole, were so named by Hevelius in honour of the
navigator Ferdinand Magellan.</p>

<p>Many other star-groupings have been proposed from time to
time; in some cases a separate name has been given to a part
of an authoritatively accepted constellation, e.g. Ensis Orionis,
the sword of Orion, or an ancient constellation may be subdivided,
e.g. Argo (ship) into Argo, Malus (mast), Vela (sails), Puppis
(stern), Carina (keel); and whereas some of the rearrangements,
which have been mostly confined to the southern hemisphere,
have been accepted, many, reflecting nothing but idiosyncrasies of
the proposers, have deservedly dropped into oblivion. Nicolas
Louis de Lacaille, who made extended observations of the
southern stars in 1751 and in the following years, and whose
results were embodied in his posthumous <i>Coelum australe
stelliferum</i> (1763), introduced the following new constellations:&mdash;Apparatus
sculptoris (Sculptor&rsquo;s workshop), Fornax chemica
(Chemical furnace), Horologium (Clock), Reticulus rhomboidalis
(Rhomboidal net), Caela sculptoris (Sculptor&rsquo;s chisels), Equuleus
pictoris (Painter&rsquo;s easel), Pyxis nautica (Mariner&rsquo;s compass),
Antlia pneumatica (Air pump), Octans (Octant), Circinus (Compasses),
Norma <i>alias</i> Quadra Euclidis (Square), Telescopium
(Telescope), Microscopium (Microscope) and Mons Mensae
(Table Mountain). Pierre Charles Lemonnier in 1776 introduced
Tarandus (Reindeer), and Solitarius; J. J. L. de Lalande

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CONSTITUTION AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.</span> The word
constitution (<i>constitutio</i>) in the time of the Roman empire
signified a collection of laws or ordinances made by the emperor.
We find the word used in the same sense in the early history of
English law, <i>e.g.</i> the Constitutions of Clarendon. In its modern
use constitution has been restricted to those rules which concern
the political structure of society. If we take the accepted
definition of a law as a command imposed by a sovereign on the
subject, the constitution would consist of the rules which point
out where the sovereign is to be found, the form in which his
powers are exercised, and the relations of the different members
of the sovereign body to each other where it consists of more
persons than one. In every independent political society, it
is assumed by these definitions, there will be found somewhere
or other a sovereign, whether that sovereign be a single person,
or a body of persons, or several bodies of persons. The commands
imposed by the sovereign person or body on the rest of
the society are positive laws, properly so called. The sovereign
body not only makes laws, but has two other leading functions,
viz. those of judicature and administration. Legislation is
for the most part performed directly by the sovereign body
itself; judicature and administration, for the most part, by
delegates. The constitution of a society, accordingly, would
show how the sovereign body is composed, and what are the
relations of its members <i>inter se</i>, and how the sovereign functions
of legislation, judicature and administration are exercised.
Constitutional law consists of the rules relating to these subjects,
and these rules may either be laws properly so called, or they
may not&mdash;i.e. they may or may not be commands imposed by
the sovereign body itself. The
English constitutional rule, for
example, that the king and
parliament are the sovereign,
cannot be called a law; for a
law presupposes the fact which it
asserts. And other rules, which
are constantly observed in practice,
but have never been enacted
by the sovereign power, are in
the same way constitutional laws
which are not laws. It is an
undoubted rule of the English
constitution that the king shall
not refuse his assent to a bill
which has passed both Houses
of Parliament, but it is certainly
not a law. Should the king veto
such a bill his action would be
unconstitutional, but not illegal.
On the other hand the rules relating
to the election of members
to the House of Commons are
nearly all positive laws strictly
so called. Constitutional law,
as the phrase is commonly used,
would include all the laws dealing with the sovereign body in the
exercise of its various functions, and all the rules, not being
laws properly so called, relating to the same subject.</p>

<p>The above is an attempt to indicate the meaning of the
phrases in their stricter or more technical uses. Some wider
meanings may be noticed. In the phrase constitutional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>15</span>
government, a form of government based on certain principles
which may roughly be called popular is the leading idea. Great
Britain, Switzerland, the United States, are all constitutional
governments in this sense of the word. A country where a large
portion of the people has some considerable share in the supreme
power would be a constitutional country. On the other hand,
constitutional, as applied to governments, may mean stable as
opposed to unstable and anarchic societies. Again, as a term
of party politics, constitutional has come to mean, in England,
not obedience to constitutional rules as above described, but
adherence to the existing type of the constitution or to some
conspicuous portions thereof,&mdash;in other words, conservative.</p>

<p>The ideas associated with constitution and constitutionalism
are thus, it will be seen, mainly of modern and European origin.
They are wholly inapplicable to the primitive and simple societies
of the present or of the former times. The discussion of forms
of government occupies a large space in the writings of the Greek
philosophers,&mdash;a fact which is to be explained by the existence
among the Greeks of many independent political communities,
variously organized, and more or less democratic in character.
Between the political problems of the smaller societies and those
of the great European nations there is no useful parallel to be
drawn, although the predominance of classical learning made
it the fashion for a long time to apply Greek speculations on the
nature of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy to public
questions in modern Europe. <a href="#artlinks">Representation</a> (q.v.), the characteristic
principle of European constitutions, has, of course,
no place in societies which were not too large to admit of every
free citizen participating personally in the business of government.
Nor is there much in the politics or the political literature
of the Romans to compare with the constitutions of modern
states. Their political system, almost from the beginning of
empire, was ruled absolutely by a small assembly or by one man.</p>

<p>The impetus to constitutional government in modern times
has to a large extent come from England, and it is from English
politics that the phrase and its associations have been borrowed.
England has offered to the world the one conspicuous example
of a long, continuous, and orderly development of political
institutions. The early date at which the principle of self-government
was established in England, the steady growth of
the principle, the absence of civil dissension, and the preservation
in the midst of change of so much of the old organization, have
given its constitution a great influence over the ideas of politicians
in other countries. This fact is expressed in the proverbial
phrase&mdash;&ldquo;England is the mother of parliaments.&rdquo; It would
not be difficult to show that the leading features of the constitutions
now established in other nations have been based on,
or defended by, considerations arising from the political history
of England.</p>

<p>In one important respect England differs conspicuously
from most other countries. Her constitution is to a large extent
<i>unwritten</i>, using the word in much the same sense as when we
speak of unwritten law. Its rules can be found in no written
document, but depend, as so much of English law does, on
precedent modified by a constant process of interpretation.
Many rules of the constitution have in fact a purely legal history,
that is to say, they have been developed by the law courts,
as part of the general body of the common law. Others have in a
similar way been developed by the practice of parliament. Both
Houses, in fact, have exhibited the same spirit of adherence to
precedent, coupled with a power of modifying precedent to
suit circumstances, which distinguishes the judicial tribunals.
In a constitutional crisis the House of Commons appoints a
committee to &ldquo;search its journals for precedents,&rdquo; just as the
court of king&rsquo;s bench would examine the records of its own
decisions. And just as the law, while professing to remain the
same, is in process of constant change, so, too, the unwritten
constitution is, without any acknowledgment of the fact, constantly
taking up new ground.</p>

<p>In contrast with the mobility of an unwritten constitution
is the fixity of a constitution written out, like that of the United
States or Switzerland, in one authoritative code. The constitution
of the United States, drawn up at Philadelphia in 1787,
is contained in a code of articles. It was ratified separately
by each state, and thenceforward became the positive and
exclusive statement of the constitution. The legislative powers
of the legislature are not to extend to certain kinds of bills, e.g.
<i>ex post facto</i> bills; the president has a veto which can only be
overcome by a majority of two-thirds in both Houses; the constitution
itself can only be changed in any particular by the consent
of the legislatures or conventions of three-fourths of the
several states; and finally the judges of the Supreme Court are
to decide in all disputed cases whether an act of the legislature
is permitted by the constitution or not.</p>

<p>The constitution of the United States is the supreme law of
the land as to the matters which it embraces. The constitution
of each state is the supreme law of the state, except so far as it
may be controlled by the constitution of the United States.
Every statute in conflict with the constitution to which it is
subordinate is void so far as this conflict extends. If it concerns
only a distinct and separable part of the statute, that part only
is void. Every court before which a statutory right or defence
is asserted has the power to inquire whether the statute in
question is or is not in conflict with the paramount constitution.
This power belongs even to a justice of the peace in trying a
cause. He sits to administer the law, and it is for him to determine
what is the law. Inferior courts commonly decline to hold
a statute unconstitutional, even if there may appear to be
substantial grounds for such a decision. The presumption is
always in favour of the validity of the law, and they generally
prefer to leave the responsibility of declaring it void to the higher
courts.</p>

<p>The judges of the state courts are bound by their oath of office
to support the constitution of the United States. They have an
equal right with those of the United States to determine whether
or how far it affects any matter brought in question in any
action. So, vice versa, the judges of the United States courts,
if the point comes up on a trial before them, have the right to
determine whether or how far the constitution of a state invalidates
a statute of the state. They, however, are ordinarily
bound to follow the views of the state courts on such a question.
They are not bound by any decision of a state court as to the
effect of the constitution of the United States on a state statute
or any other matter. This judicial power of declaring a statute
void because unconstitutional has been not infrequently exercised,
from the time when the first state constitutions were adopted.</p>

<p>Juries in criminal causes are sometimes made by American
statutes or recognized by American practice as judges of the law
as well as the fact. The better opinion is that this does not
make them judges of whether a law on which the prosecution
rests violates the paramount constitution and is therefore void
(<i>United States</i> v. <i>Callender</i>, Wharton&rsquo;s <i>State Trials</i>, 688; <i>State</i> v.
<i>Main</i>, 69 Connecticut Reports, 123, 128).</p>

<p>If a state court decides a point of constitutional law, set up
under the constitution of the United States, against the party
relying upon it, and this decision is affirmed by the state court
of last resort, he may sue out a writ of error, and so bring his
case before the Supreme Court of the United States. If the
state decision be in his favour, the other side cannot resort to
like proceedings.</p>

<p>A decree of the Supreme Court of the United States on a point
of construction arising under the constitution of the United
States settles it for all courts, state and national.</p>

<p>The salient characteristic of the United States constitution is,
perhaps, its formidable apparatus of provisions against change;
and, in fact, only 15 constitutional amendments had been adopted
from 1789 up to 1909, the last being in 1870. In the same period
the unwritten constitution of England has made a most marked
advance, chiefly in the direction of democratizing the monarchy,
and diminishing the powers of the House of Lords. The House
of Commons has continuously asserted its legislative predominance,
and has reduced the other House to the position of a
revising chamber, which in the last resort, however, can produce
a legislative deadlock, subject to the results of a new general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>16</span>
election (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Parliament</a></span>). And the cabinet, which depends on
the support of the House of Commons, has become more and
more the executive council of the realm. One conspicuous
feature of the English constitution, by which it is broadly distinguished
from written or artificial constitutions, is the presence
throughout its entire extent of legal fictions. The influence of
the lawyers on the progress of the constitution has already been
noticed, and is nowhere more clearly shown than in this peculiarity
of its structure. As in the common law, so in the constitution,
change has been effected in substance without any corresponding
change in terminology. There is hardly one of the phrases used to
describe the position of the crown which can be understood in its
literal sense, and many of them are currently accepted in more
senses than one. The American constitution of 1789 reproduced,
however, in essentials, and with necessary modifications, the
contemporary British model, and, where it did so, has preserved
the old conception of what was then the British system of
Government. The position and powers of the president were
a fair counterpart of the royal prerogative of that day; the
two houses of Congress corresponded sufficiently well to the
House of Lords and the House of Commons, allowing for the
absence of the elements of hereditary rank and territorial influence.
While the English constitution has changed much, the
American constitution has changed very little in these respects.
Allowing for the more democratic character of the constituencies,
the organization of the supreme power in the United States is
nearer the English type of the 18th century&mdash;is, in fact, less
elastic than in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is not uncommon to misinterpret the
rigidity of the United States constitution, from a regard rather
to the theory which its text suggests than to the practical
working of the machine. For the letter of the constitution has
to some extent been modified, if not technically amended, in
various respects by judicial interpretation, and by use and wont
(e.g. as regards the election of the president). This side of the
matter may be studied in C. G. Tiedeman&rsquo;s work cited below.
Moreover, even in respect of the 18th-century British character
attaching to the constitution, as drawn up in 1787, it has to be
remembered that this was not taken direct from England. As
several American constitutional historians have elaborately
shown (e.g. A. C. McLaughlin, in <i>The Confederation and the
Constitution</i>, 1905), the English idea had already been developed
in various directions during the preceding colonial period, and
the constitution really represented the English constitutional
usage <i>as known in America</i>, into which the Philadelphia convention
introduced new features corresponding to the prevailing
civil conditions or suggested by English analogy. It is important
to emphasize this point, since the resemblance of the American
constitution of 1789 to the contemporary English constitution
has sometimes been exaggerated; but the fact remains that the
written constitution has been less susceptible of development
than the unwritten.</p>

<p>Between England and some other constitutional countries a
difference of much constitutional importance is to be found in
the terms on which the component parts of the country were
brought together. All great societies have been produced by
the aggregation of small societies into larger and larger groups.
In England the process of consolidation was completed before
the constitution settled down into its present form. In the
United States, on the other hand, in Switzerland, and in Germany
the constitution is in form an alliance among a number of
separate states, each of which may have a constitution and
laws of its own for local purposes. In federal governments it
remains a question how far the independence of individual
states has been sacrificed by submission to a constitution. In
the United States constitutional progress is hampered by the
necessity thus created of having every amendment ratified by
the separate vote of three-fourths of the states.</p>

<p><span class="bold">&ldquo;CONSTITUTION OF ATHENS&rdquo;</span> (<span class="grk" title="Athênaiôn politeia">&#902;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span>), a work
attributed to the philosopher Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), forming
one of a series of <i>Constitutions</i> (<span class="grk" title="politeiai">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#953;</span>), 158 in number, which
treated of the institutions of the various states in the Greek
world. It was extant until the 7th century of our era, or to an
even later date, but was subsequently lost. A copy of this
treatise, written in four different hands upon four rolls of papyrus,
and dating from the end of the 1st century A.D., was discovered
in Egypt, and acquired by the trustees of the British Museum,
for whom it was edited by F. G. Kenyon, assistant in the manuscript
department, and published in January 1891. Some very
imperfect fragments of another copy had been acquired by the
Egyptian Museum at Berlin, and were published in 1880.</p>

<p><i>Authorship.</i>&mdash;It may be regarded as now established that the
treatise discovered in Egypt is identical with the work upon the
constitution of Athens that passed in antiquity under the name of
Aristotle. The evidence derived from a comparison of the
British Museum papyrus with the quotations from the lost work
of Aristotle&rsquo;s which are found in scholiasts and grammarians is
conclusive. Of fifty-eight quotations from Aristotle&rsquo;s work, fifty-five
occur in the papyrus. Of thirty-three quotations from
Aristotle, which relate to matters connected with the constitution,
or the constitutional history of Athens, although
they are not expressly referred to the <span class="grk" title="Athênaiôn politeia">&#902;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span>,
twenty-three are found in the papyrus. Of those not found
in the papyrus, the majority appear to have come either
from the beginning of the treatise, which is wanting in the
papyrus, or from the latter portion of it, which is mutilated.
The coincidence, therefore, is as nearly as possible complete.
It may also be regarded as established by internal evidence that
the treatise was composed during the interval between Aristotle&rsquo;s
return to Athens in 335 B.C. and his death in 322. There are two
passages which give us the latter year as the <i>terminus ad quem</i>,
viz. c. 42. 1 and c. 62. 2. In the former passage the democracy
which is about to be described is spoken of as the &ldquo;present
constitution&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="ê nun katastasis tês politeias">&#7969; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>). The democratic
constitution was abolished, and a timocracy established, on the
surrender of Athens to Antipater, at the end of the Lamian War,
in the autumn of 322. At the same time Samos was lost; it is
still reckoned, however, among the Athenian possessions in the
latter passage. On the other hand, the foreign possessions
of Athens are limited to Lemnos, Imbros, Scyros, Delos and
Samos. This could only apply to the period after Chaeronea
(338 B.C.). In c. 61. 1, again, mention is made of a special
Strategus <span class="grk" title="epi tas symmorias">&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#956;&#956;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>; but it can be proved from inscriptions
that down to the year 334 the generals were <i>collectively</i> concerned
with the symmories. Finally, in c. 54. 7 an event is dated
by the archonship of Cephisophon (329). We thus get the
years 329 and 322 as fixing the limits of the period to which the
composition of the work must be assigned. It follows that,
whether it is by Aristotle or not, its date is later than that of the
<i>Politics</i>, in which there is no reference to any event subsequent
to the death of Philip in 336.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>17</span></p>

<p>The only question as to authorship that can fairly be raised
is the question whether it is by Aristotle or by a pupil; i.e. as to
the sense in which it is &ldquo;Aristotelian.&rdquo; The argument on the
two sides may be summarized as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Against.</i>&mdash;(i.) The occurrence of non-Aristotelian words and
phrases and the absence of turns of expression characteristic of
the undisputed writings of Aristotle. (ii.) The occurrence of
statements contradictory of views found in the <i>Politics</i>; e.g.
c. 4 (Constitution of Draco) compared with <i>Pol.</i> 1274 b 15

selected candidates) compared with <i>Pol.</i> 1274 a 17, and 1281
b 31 (the archons elected by the <i>demos</i>); c. 17. 1 (total length of
Peisistratus&rsquo; reign, 19 years) compared with <i>Pol.</i> 1315 b 32
(total length, 17 years); c. 21. 6 (Cleisthenes left the clan and
phratries unaltered) compared with <i>Pol.</i> 1319 b 20 (Cleisthenes
increased the number of the phratries); c. 21. 2 and 4 compared
with <i>Pol.</i> 1275 b 37 (different views as to the class admitted
to citizenship by Cleisthenes). It will be observed that the
instances quoted relate to the most famous names in the early
history of Athens, viz. Draco, Solon, Peisistratus and Cleisthenes.
(iii.) Arguments drawn from the style, composition and general
character of the work, which are alleged to be unworthy of the
author of the undoubtedly genuine writings. There is no sense
of proportion (contrast the space devoted to Peisistratus and his
sons, or to the Four Hundred and the Thirty, with the inadequate
treatment of the period between the Persian and Peloponnesian
Wars); there is a lack of historical insight and an uncritical
acceptance of erroneous views; and the anecdotic element is
unduly prominent. These considerations led several of the earlier
critics to deny the Aristotelian authorship, e.g. the editors of the
Dutch edition of the text, van Herwerden and van Leeuwen;
Rühl, Cauer and Schvarcz in Germany; H. Richards and others
in England.</p>

<p><i>For.</i>&mdash;(i.) The consensus of antiquity. Every ancient writer
who mentions the <i>Constitution</i> attributes it to Aristotle, while no
writer is known to have questioned its genuineness. (ii.) The
coincidence of the date assigned to its composition on internal
grounds with the date of Aristotle&rsquo;s second residence in Athens.
(iii.) Parallelisms of thought or expression with passages in the
<i>Politics</i>; e.g. c. 16. 2 and 3 compared with <i>Pol.</i> 1318 b 14 and
1319 a 30; the general view of Solon&rsquo;s legislation compared with
<i>Pol.</i> 1296 b 1; c. 27. 3 compared with <i>Pol.</i> 1274 a 9. To
argument (i.) against the authorship, it is replied that the
<i>Constitution</i> is an historical work, intended for popular use;
differences in style and terminology from those of a philosophical
treatise, such as the <i>Politics</i>, are to be expected. To argument
(ii.) it is replied that, as the <i>Constitution</i> is a later work than the
<i>Politics</i>, a change of view upon particular points is not surprising.
These considerations have led the great majority of writers upon
the subject to attribute the work to Aristotle himself. On this
side are found Kenyon and Sandys among English scholars, and
in Germany, Wilamowitz, Blass, Gilbert, Bauer, Bruno Keil,
Busolt, E. Meyer, and many others. On the whole, it can hardly
be doubted that the view which is supported by so great a weight
of authority is the correct one. The arguments advanced on the
other side are not to be lightly set aside, but they can scarcely
outweigh the combination of external and internal evidence in
favour of the attribution to Aristotle. An attentive study of the
parallel passages in the <i>Politics</i> will go a long way towards
carrying conviction. It is true that a series such as the <i>Constitutions</i>
might well be entrusted to pupils working under the direction
of their master. It is also true, however, that the
<i>Constitution of Athens</i> must have been incomparably the most
important of the series and the one that would be most naturally
reserved for the master&rsquo;s hand. There are no traces in the
treatise either of variety of authorship or of incompleteness,
though there are evidences of interpolation.</p>

<p><i>Contents.</i>&mdash;The treatise consists of two parts, one historical,
and the other descriptive. The first forty-one chapters compose
the former part, the remainder of the work the latter. The first
part comprised an account of the original constitution of Athens,
and of the eleven changes through which it successively passed
(see c. 41). The papyrus, however, is imperfect at the beginning
(the manuscript from which it was copied appears to have been
similarly defective), the text commencing in the middle of a
sentence which relates to the trial and banishment of the
Alcmeonidae for their part in the affair of Cylon. The missing
chapters must have contained a sketch of the original constitution,
and of the changes introduced in the time of Ion and
Theseus.</p>

<div class="condenced">
<p>The following is an abstract of Part I. in its present form.
Chapters 2, 3, description of the constitution before the time of Draco.
4, Draco&rsquo;s constitution. 5-12, reforms of Solon. 13, party feuds
after the legislation of Solon. 14-19, the rule of Peisistratus and his
sons. 20, 21, the reforms of Cleisthenes. 22, changes introduced
between Cleisthenes and the invasion of Xerxes. 23, 24, the supremacy
of the Areopagus, 479-461 B.C. 25, its overthrow by Ephialtes.
26, 27, changes introduced in the time of Pericles. 28, the rise of the
demagogues. 29-33, the revolution of the Four Hundred. 34-40,
the government of the Thirty. 41, list of the successive changes in
the constitution. It may be noted that the reforms of Solon, the
tyranny of Peisistratus and his sons, and the revolutions of the Four
Hundred and the Thirty, together occupy considerably more than
two-thirds of Part I.</p>

<p>Part II. describes the constitution as it existed at the period of
the composition of the treatise (329-322 B.C.). It begins with an
account of the conditions of citizenship and of the training of the
<i>ephebi</i> (citizens between the ages of 18 and 20). In chapters 43-49
the functions of the Council (<span class="grk" title="boulê">&#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#942;</span>) and of the officials who act in
concert with it are described. 50-60 deal with the officials who are
appointed by lot, of whom the most important are the nine Archons,
to whose functions five chapters (55-59) are devoted. The military
officers, who come under the head of elective officials, form the
subject of c. 61. With c. 63 begins the section on the Law-courts,
which occupied the remainder of the <i>Constitution</i>. This portion,
with the exception of c. 63, is fragmentary in character, owing to the
mutilated condition of the fourth roll of the papyrus on which it was
written. It will thus be seen that the subjects which receive fullest
treatment in Part II. are the Council, the Archons and the Law-courts.
The Ecclesia, on the other hand, is dealt with very briefly,
in connexion with the <i>prytaneis</i> and <i>proedri</i> (cc. 43, 44).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Sources.</i>&mdash;The labours of several workers in this field, notably
Bruno Keil and Wilamowitz, have rendered it comparatively
easy to form a general estimate of Aristotle&rsquo;s indebtedness to
previous writers, although problems of great difficulty are
encountered as soon as it is attempted to determine the precise
sources from which the historical part of the work is derived.
Among these sources are unquestionably Herodotus (for the
tyranny of Peisistratus, and for the struggle between Cleisthenes
and Isagoras), Thucydides (for the episode of Harmodius and
Aristogeiton, and for the Four Hundred), Xenophon (for the
Thirty), and the poems of Solon. There is now among critics
a general consensus in favour of the view that the most important
of his sources was the <i>Atthis</i> of Androtion, a work published
in all probability only a few years earlier than the <i>Constitution</i>;
in any case, after the year 346. From it are derived not only
the passages which are annalistic in character and read like
excerpts from a chronicle (e.g. c. 13. 1, 2; c. 22; c. 26. 2, 3),
but also most of the matter common to the <i>Constitution</i> and to
Plutarch&rsquo;s <i>Solon</i>. The coincidences with Plutarch, which are
often verbal, and extend to about 50 lines out of 170 in cc. 5-11
of the <i>Constitution</i>, can best be explained on the hypothesis
that Hermippus, the writer followed by Plutarch, used the
same source as Aristotle, viz. the <i>Atthis</i> of Androtion. Androtion
is probably closely followed in the account of the pre-Draconian
constitution, and to him appear to be due the explanation of
local names (e.g. <span class="grk" title="chôrion ateles">&#967;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#941;&#962;</span>), or proverbial expressions (e.g.
<span class="grk" title="to mê phylokrinein">&#964;&#8056; &#956;&#8052; &#966;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>), as well as the account of &ldquo;Strategems&rdquo;
such as that of Themistocles against the Areopagus (c. 25) or
that employed by Peisistratus in order to disarm the people
(c. 15. 4). Whether the anecdotes, which are a conspicuous
feature in the <i>Constitution</i>, should be referred to the same source
is more open to doubt. It is also generally agreed that among
the sources was a work, written towards the end of the 5th
century B.C., by an author of oligarchical sympathies, with the
object of defaming the character and policy of the heroes of the
democracy. This source can be traced in passages such as
c. 6. 2 (Solon turning the Seisachtheia to the profit of himself and
his friends), 9. 2 (obscurity of Solon&rsquo;s laws intentional, cf. c. 35. 2),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>18</span>
27. 4 (Pericles&rsquo; motive for the introduction of the dicasts&rsquo; pay).
But while the object (<span class="grk" title="oi boulomenoi blasphêmein">&#959;&#7985; &#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#946;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#966;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, c. 6) and the
date of this oligarchical pamphlet (for the date cf. Plutarch&rsquo;s
<i>Solon</i>, c. 15 <span class="grk" title="oi peri Konôna kai Kleinian kai Hipponikon">&#959;&#7984; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#7985; &#922;&#972;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#922;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#906;&#960;&#960;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#957;</span>, which
points to a time when Conon, Alcibiades and Callias were prominent
in public life) are fairly certain, the authorship is quite
uncertain, as is also its relationship to another source of importance,
viz. that from which are derived the accounts of the
Four Hundred and the Thirty. The view taken of the character
and course of these revolutions betrays a strong bias in favour
of Theramenes, whose ideal is alleged to have been the <span class="grk" title="patrios
politeia">&#960;&#940;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span>. It has been maintained, on the one hand, that this
last source (the authority followed in the accounts of the Four
Hundred and the Thirty) is identical with the oligarchical
pamphlet, and, on the other, that it is none other than the <i>Atthis</i>
of Androtion. The former hypothesis is improbable. In favour
of the latter two arguments may be adduced. In the first place,
Androtion&rsquo;s father, Andron, was one of the Four Hundred, and
took Theramenes&rsquo; side. Secondly, the precise marks of time,
which are characteristic of the <i>Atthis</i>, are conspicuous in these
chapters. In view, however, of the fact that Androtion in his
political career showed himself not only a democrat, but a
democrat of the extreme school, the hypothesis must be
pronounced untenable.</p>

<p><i>Value.</i>&mdash;It is by no means easy to convey a just impression of
the value of Aristotle&rsquo;s work as an authority for the constitutional
history of Athens. In all that relates to the practice of
his own day Aristotle&rsquo;s authority is final. There can be no
question, therefore, as to the importance, or the trustworthy
character, of the Second Part. But even here a caution is
necessary. It must be remembered that its authority is final
for the 4th century only, and that we are not justified in arguing
from the practice of the 4th century to that of the 5th, unless
corroborative evidence is available. In the First Part, however,
where he is treating of the institutions and practice of a past
age, Aristotle&rsquo;s authority is very far from being final. An
analysis of this part of the work discloses his dependence, in a
remarkable degree, upon his sources. Occasionally he compares,
criticizes or combines; as a rule he adheres closely to the
writer whom he is using. There is no evidence, either of independent
inquiry, or of the utilization of other sources than
literary ones. Where &ldquo;original documents&rdquo; are quoted, or
referred to, as e.g. in the history of the Four Hundred, or of the
Thirty, it is probable that he derived them from a previous
writer. For the authority of Aristotle we must substitute,
therefore, the authority of his sources; i.e. the value of any
particular statement will vary with the character of the source
from which it comes. For the history of the 5th century the
passages which come from Androtion&rsquo;s <i>Atthis</i> carry with them
a high degree of authority. It by no means follows, however,
that a statement relating to earlier times is to be accepted
simply because it is derived from the same source. And in
passages which are derived from other sources than the <i>Atthis</i>
a much lower degree of authority can be claimed, even for statements
relating to the 5th century. The supremacy of the
Areopagus after the Persian Wars, the policy attributed to
Aristides (c. 24), and the association of Themistocles with
Ephialtes, are cases in point. Nor must the reader expect to
find in the <i>Constitution</i> a great work, in any sense of the term.
The style, it is true, is simple and clear, and the writer&rsquo;s criticisms
are sensible. But the reader will look in vain for evidence of
the philosophic insight which makes the <i>Politics</i>, even at the
present day, the best text-book of political philosophy. It is
perhaps hardly too much to say that there is not a single great
idea in the whole work. He will look in vain, too, for any
consistent view of the history of the constitution as a whole,
or for any adequate account of its development. He will find
occasional misunderstandings of measures, and confusions of
thought. There are appreciations which it is difficult to accept,
and inaccuracies which it is difficult to pardon. There are
contradictions which the author has overlooked, and there are
omissions which are unaccountable. Yet, in spite of such defects,
the importance of the <i>Constitution</i> can hardly be exaggerated.
Its recovery has rendered obsolete any history of the Athenian
constitution that was written before the year 1891. Before
this date our knowledge was largely derived from the statements
of scholiasts and lexicographers which had not seldom been
misunderstood. The recovery of the <i>Constitution</i> puts us for
the first time in possession of the evidence. To appreciate the
difference that has been made by its recovery, it is only necessary
to compare what we now know of the reforms of Cleisthenes
with what we formerly knew. It is much of it evidence that
needs a careful process of weighing and sifting before it can be
safely used; but it is, as a rule, the best, or the only evidence.
The First Part may be less trustworthy than the Second; it is
not less indispensable to the student of constitutional history.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONSUETUDINARY</span> (Med. Lat. <i>consuetudinarius</i>, from <i>consuetudo</i>,
custom), customary, a term used especially of law
based on custom as opposed to statutory or written law. As a
noun &ldquo;consuetudinary&rdquo; (Lat. <i>consuetudinarius</i>, sc. <i>liber</i>) is the
name given to a ritual book containing the forms and ceremonies
used in the services of a particular monastery, cathedral or
religious order.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONSUL</span> (in Gr. generally <span class="grk" title="hypatos">&#8019;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, a shortened form of <span class="grk" title="stratêgos
hypatos">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#951;&#947;&#8056;&#962; &#8019;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, i.e. <i>praetor maximus</i>), the title borne by the two highest
of the ordinary magistrates of the whole Roman community
during the republic. In the imperial period these magistrates
had ceased practically to be the heads of the state, but their
technical position remained unaltered. (For the modern
commercial office of consul see the separate article below.)</p>

<p>The consulship arose with the fall of the ancient monarchy
(see further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rome</a>:</span> <i>History</i>, II. &ldquo;The Republic&rdquo;). The Roman
reverence for the abstract conception of the magistracy, as
expressed in the imperium and the auspicia, led to the preservation
of the regal power weakened only by external
limitations. The two new officials who replaced the king bore
the titles of leaders (<i>praetores</i>) and of judges (<i>judices</i>; cf. Cicero,
<i>De legibus</i>, iii. 3. 8, &ldquo;regio imperio duo sunto iique a praeeundo
judicando ... praetores judices ... appellamino&rdquo;). But the
new fact of colleagueship caused a third title to prevail, that
of <i>consules</i> or &ldquo;partners,&rdquo; a word probably derived from <i>consalio</i>
on the analogy of <i>praesul</i> and <i>exul</i> (Mommsen, <i>Staatsrecht</i>,
ii. p. 77, n. 3). This first example of the collegiate principle
assumed the form that soon became familiar in the Roman
commonwealth. Each of the pair of magistrates could act up to
the full powers of the imperium; but the dissent of his colleague
rendered his decision or his action null and void. At the same
time the principle of a merely annual tenure of office was insisted
on. The two magistrates at the close of their year of office were
bound to transmit their power to successors; and these successors
whom they nominated were obliged to seek the suffrages of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>19</span>
people. The only body known to us as electing the consuls
during the republican period was the <i>comitia centuriata</i> (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Comitia</a></span>). The consulate was originally confined to patricians.
During the struggle for higher office that was waged between
the orders the office was suspended on fifty-one occasions
between the years 444 and 367 B.C. and replaced by the military
tribunate with consular power, to which plebeians were eligible.
The struggle was brought to an end by the Licinio-Sextian laws
of 367 B.C., which enacted that one consul must be a plebeian
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Patricians</a></span>).</p>

<p>Most of the internal history of Rome down to the beginning
of the third century B.C. consists in a series of attacks, whether
intentional or accidental, on the power of the executive. As
the consuls are the sole representatives of higher executive
authority in early times, this history is one of a progressive
decline in the originally wide and arbitrary powers of the office.
Their right of summary criminal jurisdiction was weakened by
the successive laws of appeal (<i>provocatio</i>); their capacity for
interpreting the civil law at their pleasure by the publication
of the Twelve Tables and the Forms of Action. The growth
of the tribunate of the plebs hampered their activity both as
legislators and as judges. They surrendered the duties of
registration to the censors in 443 B.C., and the rights of civil
jurisdiction and control over the market and police to the
praetor and the curule aediles in 367 B.C.</p>

<p>The result of these limitations and of this specialization of
functions in the community was to leave the consuls with less
specific duties at home than any magistrates in the state. But
the absence of specific functions may be of itself a sign of a general
duty of supervision. The consuls were in a very real sense the
heads of the state. Polybius describes them as controlling the
whole administration (Polyb. vi. 12 <span class="grk" title="pasôn eisi kurioi tôn dêmosiôn
praxeôn">&#960;&#945;&#963;&#8182;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#963;&#953; &#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#948;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#940;&#958;&#949;&#969;&#957;</span>). This control they exercised in concert with the
senate, whose chief servants they were. It was they who were
the most regular consultants of this council, who formulated
its decrees as edicts, and who brought before the people legislative
measures which the senate had approved. It was they also who
represented the state to the outer world and introduced foreign
envoys to the senate. The symbols of their presidency were
manifold. It was marked by the twelve <a href="#artlinks">lictors</a> (q.v.), a number
permitted to no other ordinary magistrate, by the fact that the
first act of newly-admitted consuls was to take the auspices,
their second to summon the senate, and by the use of their names
for dating the year. The consulate was, indeed, as Cicero expresses
it, the culminating point in an official career (&ldquo;Honorum populi
finis est consulatus,&rdquo; Cic. <i>Pro Planco</i>, 25. 60).</p>

<p>In the domestic sphere the consuls retained certain powers
of jurisdiction. This jurisdiction was either (i.) administrative
or (ii.) criminal. (i.) Their administrative jurisdiction was sometimes
concerned with financial matters such as pecuniary claims
made by the state and individuals against one another. They
acted in these matters in the periods during which the censors
were not in office. We also find them adjudicating in disputes
about property between the cities of Italy, (ii.) Their criminal
jurisdiction was of three kinds. In the first place it was their
duty, before the development of the standing commissions
which originated in the middle of the 2nd century B.C., to set in
motion the criminal law against offenders for the cognizance of
ordinary, as opposed to political, crimes. The reference of such
cases to the assembly of the people was effected through their
quaestors (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Quaestor</a></span>). Secondly, when the people and
senate, or the senate alone, appointed a special commission
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Senate</a></span>), the commissioner named was often a consul.
Thirdly, we find the consul conducting a criminal inquiry raised
by a point of international law. It is possible that in this case
his advising body (<i>consilium</i>) was composed of the <i>fetiales</i> (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Herald</a></span>, ad fin.). (Cicero, <i>De republica</i>, iii. 18. 28; Mommsen,
<i>Staatsrecht</i>, ii. p. 112, n. 3).</p>

<p>During the greater part of the republic the consuls were
recognized as the heads of the administration abroad as well as
at home. It thus became necessary that departments of administration
(<i>provinciae</i>) should be determined and assigned. The
method of assignment varied. The least usual device was for
one consul to take the field at the head of an army, while the
other remained at home to transact the civil business of state.
More often foreign wars demanded the attention of both consuls.
In this case the regular army of four legions was usually divided
between them. When it was necessary that both armies should
co-operate, the principle of rotation was adopted, each consul
having the command for a single day&mdash;a practice which may be
illustrated by the events preceding the battle of Cannae (Polybius
iii. 110; Livy xxii. 41). During the great period of conquest
from 264 to 146 B.C. Italy was generally one of the consular
&ldquo;provinces,&rdquo; some foreign country the other; and when at the
close of this period Italy was at peace, this distinction approximated
to one between civil and military command. The consuls
settled their departments amongst themselves by agreement
or by lot (<i>comparatio</i>, <i>sortitio</i>), the power of declaring what
should be the consular <i>provinciae</i> was usurped by the senate,
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Senate</a></span>), and a <i>lex Sempronia</i> passed by C. Gracchus,
probably in 122 B.C., ordained that the two consular provinces
should be declared before the election of the consuls. At this
time the consuls entered office on the 1st of January (a practice
which commenced in 153 B.C.), and their military command began
on the 1st of March. They could hold this military command
until they were superseded in the following March, and thus their
tenure of power was practically raised to fourteen months. But
meanwhile the home officials invested with the imperium had
proved insufficient for the military needs of the empire, and the
system of prolonging the command (<i>prorogatio imperii</i>) had been
growing up (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Province</a></span>). The consul whose command had
been prolonged now served abroad as proconsul. It is probable
that Sulla in his legislation of 81 B.C. did something to stereotype
this system. Certainly the government by pro-magistrates becomes
the rule after this period (cf. Cicero, <i>De natura deorum</i>,
ii. 3. 9; <i>De divinatione</i>, ii. 36. 76, 77), although there are several
instances of consuls assuming the active command of provinces
between the years 74 and 55 B.C. (Mommsen, <i>Rechtsfrage</i>, p. 30),
and Cicero declares that the consul has a right to approach
every province (&ldquo;consules, quibus more majorum concessum
est vel omnes adire provincias,&rdquo; Cicero, <i>Ad Atticum</i>, viii. 15. 3).
Certainly in theory the provinces were still regarded as &ldquo;consular,&rdquo;
not &ldquo;proconsular,&rdquo; and were technically, although not
practically, held from the 1st of March of the consul&rsquo;s tenure
of office at Rome (cf. Cicero, <i>De provinciis consularibus</i>, 15. 37;
Mommsen, <i>Rechtsfrage</i>, <i>passim</i>). It was not until the lex
Pompeia of 52 B.C. (Dio Cassius xl. 56) had established a five
years&rsquo; interval between home and foreign command that the
theory of the <i>prorogatio imperii</i> vanished and the proconsulate
became a separate office.</p>

<p>Since the theory of the persistence of the republican constitution
was of the essence of the Principate, the consuls necessarily
lost little of their outward position and dignity under the rule of
the Caesars. The consulship was the only office in which a citizen,
other than a member of the imperial house, might have the
princeps as a colleague, and in the interval between the death or
deposition of one princeps and the appointment of another the
consuls resumed their normal position as the heads of the state
(cf. Herodian ii. 12). As the presidents of the senate, who after
A.D. 14 elected them to their office, they were the chief personal
representatives of those elements of sovereignty that were
supposed to attach to that body, and they directed that high
criminal jurisdiction which the senate of this period assumed
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Senate</a></span>). A restored power of jurisdiction is indeed one of
the features of their position during this time, and it is probable
that the civil appeals which came to the senate were delegated
to the consuls. They also acted for a time as delegates to the
princeps in matters of Chancery jurisdiction such as trusts and
guardianship (Mommsen, <i>Staatsrecht</i>, ii. p. 103). The consulship
was also a preparation for certain high commands, such as the
government of certain public and imperial provinces (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Province</a></span>)
and the praefecture of the city. It was probably due
to the fact that the consulship was such a prize, and perhaps also
to the expense imposed on the office by its association with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>20</span>
celebration of games (Dio Cassius lvi. 46, lix. 20) that the tenure
was progressively shortened. In the early principate the consuls
hold office for six months, later for four to two months (Mommsen,
<i>Staatsrecht</i>, ii. pp. 84-87). The consuls appointed for the 1st of
January were called <i>ordinarii</i>, the others <i>suffecti</i>; and the whole
year was dated by the names of the former.</p>

<p>This distinction continued in the Empire that was founded
by Diocletian and Constantine. The <i>ordinarii</i> were nominated
by the emperor, the <i>suffecti</i> were nominated by the senate, and
their appointment was ratified by the emperor. The consulship
was still the greatest dignity which the Empire had to bestow;
and the pomp and ceremony of the office increased in proportion
to the decline in its actual power. The entry of the consuls on
office was celebrated by a great procession, by games given to
the people, by a distribution of gifts, such as the ivory diptychs,
a long series of which has been preserved. But the senate, over
which they presided until the time of Justinian, was little more
than the municipal council of the city of Rome; and the justice
which they meted out had dwindled down to the formal and
uncontested acts of manumission and the granting of guardians.
Sometimes there was a consul of the West at Rome and a consul
of the East at Constantinople; at other times both consuls
might be found in either capital. The last consul born in a private
station was Basilius in the East in A.D. 541. But the emperors
continued to bear the title for some time longer.</p>

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CONSUL,</span> a public officer authorized by the state whose commission
he bears to manage the commercial affairs of its subjects
in a foreign country, and formally permitted by the government
of the country wherein he resides to perform the duties which
are specified in his commission, or <i>lettre de provision</i>. (For the
ancient magisterial office of consul see separate article above.)</p>

<p>A consul, as such, is not invested with any diplomatic character,
and he cannot enter on his official duties until a rescript, termed
an <i>exequatur</i> (sometimes a mere countersign endorsed on the
commission), has been delivered to him by the authorities of the
state to which his nomination has been communicated by his
own government. This <i>exequatur</i>, called in Turkey a <i>barat</i>,
may be revoked at any time at the discretion of the government
where he resides. The status of consuls commissioned by the
Christian powers to reside in Mahommedan countries, China,
Korea, Siam, and, until 1899, in Japan, and to exercise judicial
functions in civil and criminal matters between their own
countrymen and strangers, is exceptional to the common law,
and is founded on special conventions or <a href="#artlinks">capitulations</a> (q.v.).</p>

<p>The title of consul, in the sense in which it is used in international
law, is derived from that of certain magistrates, in the
cities of medieval Italy, Provence and Languedoc, charged with
the settlement of trade disputes whether by sea or land (<i>consules
mercatorum, consules artis maris</i>, &amp;c.)<a name="FnAnchor_1c" href="#Footnote_1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> With the growth of trade
it early became convenient to appoint agents with similar
powers in foreign parts, and these often, though not invariably,
were styled consuls (<i>consules in partibus ultramarinis</i>).<a name="FnAnchor_2c" href="#Footnote_2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The
earliest foreign consuls were those established by Genoa, Pisa,
Venice and Florence, between 1098 and 1196, in the Levant, at
Constantinople, in Palestine, Syria and Egypt. Of these the
Pisan agent at Constantinople bore the title of consul, the
Venetian that of <a href="#artlinks">baylo</a> (q.v.). In 1251 Louis IX. of France
arranged a treaty with the sultan of Egypt under which French
consuls were established at Tripoli and Alexandria, and Du
Cange cites a charter of James of Aragon, dated 1268, granting
to the city of Barcelona the right to elect consuls in <i>partibus
ultramarinis</i>, &amp;c. The free growth of the system was, however,
hampered by commercial and dynastic rivalries. The system
of French foreign consulships, for instance, all but died out after
the crushing of the independent life of the south and the incorporation
of Provence and Languedoc under the French crown;
while, with the establishment of Venetian supremacy in the
Levant, the <i>baylo</i> developed into a diplomatic agent of the first
class at the expense of the consuls of rival states. The modern
system of consulships actually dates only from the 16th century.
Early in this century both England and Scotland had their
&ldquo;conservators&rdquo; with &ldquo;jurisdiction to do justice between
merchant and merchant beyond the seas&rdquo;; but France led the
way. The alliance between Francis I. and Suleiman the Magnificent
gave her special advantages in the Levant, of which she
was not slow to take advantage. Her success culminated in the
capitulations signed in 1604, under the terms of which her
consuls were given precedence over all others and were endowed
with diplomatic immunities (e.g. freedom from arrest and from
domiciliary visits), while the traders of all other nations were put
under the protection of the French flag. It was not till 1675
that, under the first capitulations signed with Turkey, English
consuls were established in the Ottoman empire. Ten years
earlier, under the commercial treaty between England and
Spain, they had been established in Spain.</p>

<p>The frequent wars of the succeeding century hindered the
development of the consular system. Thus, though the system
of consuls was regularly established in France by the ordinance
of 1661, in 1760 France had consuls only in the Levant, Barbary,
Italy, Spain and Portugal, while she discouraged the establishment
of foreign consuls in her own ports as tending to infringe
her own jurisdiction. It was not till the 19th century that the
system developed universally. Hitherto consuls had, for the
most part, been business men with no special qualification as
regards training; but the French system, under which the
consular service had been long established as part of the general
civil service of the country, a system that had survived the
Revolution unchanged, was gradually adopted by other nations;
though, as in France, consuls not belonging to the regular
service, and having an inferior status, continued to be appointed.
In Great Britain the consular service was organized in 1825
(see below); in France the series of ordinances and laws by which
its modern constitution was fixed began in 1833. In Germany
progress was hindered by the political conditions of the country
under the old Confederation; for the Hanse cities, which practically
monopolized the oversea trade, lacked the means to establish
a consular system on the French model. The present
magnificently organized consular system of Germany is, then,
one of the most remarkable outcomes of the establishment of the
united empire. It was initiated by an act of the parliament
of the North German Confederation (Nov. 8, 1867), subsequently
incorporated in the statutes of the Empire, which laid down
the principle that the German consulates were to be under
the immediate jurisdiction of the president of the Confederation
(later the emperor). The functions, duties and privileges of
French and German consuls do not differ materially from those
of British consuls; but there is a great difference in the organization
and <i>personnel</i> of the consular service. In France, apart
from the <i>consuls élus</i> or <i>consuls marchands</i>, who are mere consular
agents, selected by the government from among the traders of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>21</span>
town where it desires to be represented, and unsalaried, the
consular body proper was, by the decrees of July 10, 1880, and
April 27, 1883, practically constituted a branch of the diplomatic
service. It is recruited from the same sources, and its members
are free to exchange into the <i>corps diplomatique</i>, or vice versa.
Candidates for the diplomatic and consular services have to
undergo the same training and pass the same examinations,
i.e. in the constitutional, administrative and judicial organization
of the various powers, in international law, commercial
law and maritime law, in the history of treaties and in commercial
and political geography, in political economy, and in
the German and English languages. They have to serve three
years abroad or attached to some ministerial department before
they can enter for the examination which entitles them to an
appointment as attaché or as <i>consul suppléant</i>. This assimilation
of the consular to the diplomatic service remains peculiar to
France.<a name="FnAnchor_3c" href="#Footnote_3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>In Germany it was enacted by the law of February 28, 1873,
that German consuls must be either trained jurists, or must
have passed special examinations. The result of this system
has been the establishment throughout the world of an elaborate
network of trained commercial experts, directly responsible to
the central government, and charged as one of their principal
duties with the task of keeping the government informed of all
that may be of interest to German traders. These annual
consular reports were from the first regularly and promptly
published in the <i>Deutsche Handelsarchiv</i>, and have contributed
much to the wonderful expansion of German trade. The right
to establish consuls is now universally recognized by Christian
civilized states. Jurists at one time contended that according
to international law a right of &ldquo;ex-territoriality&rdquo; attached to
consuls, their persons and dwellings being sacred, and themselves
amenable to local authority only in cases of strong suspicion on
political grounds. It is now admitted that, apart from treaty,
custom has established very few consular privileges; that
perhaps consuls may be arrested and incarcerated, not merely
on criminal charges, but for civil debt; and that, if they engage
in trade or become the owners of immovable property, their
persons certainly lose protection. This question of arrest has
been frequently raised in Europe:&mdash;in the case of Barbuit, a
tallow-chandler, who from 1717 to 1735 acted as Prussian
consul in London, and to whom the exemption conferred by
statute on ambassadors was held not to apply; in the case of
Cretico, the Turkish consul in London in 1808; in the case of
Begley, the United States consul at Genoa, arrested in Paris
in 1840; and in the case of De la Fuente Hermosa, Uruguayan
consul, whom the <i>Cour Royale</i> of Paris in 1842 held liable to
arrest for debt. In the same way consuls are often exempt
from all kinds of rates and taxes, and always from personal
taxes. They are exempt from billeting and military service, but
are not entitled (except in the Levant, where also freedom
from arrest and trial is the rule) to have private chapels in their
houses. The right of consuls to exhibit their national arms and
flag over the door of the bureau is not disputed.</p>

<p>Until the year 1825 British consuls were usually merchants
engaged in trade in the foreign countries in which they acted
as consuls, and their remuneration consisted entirely of fees.
An act of that year, however, organized the consular service
as a branch of the civil service, with payment by a fixed salary
instead of by fees; consuls were forbidden also to engage in
trade, and the management of the service was put under the
control of a separate department of the foreign office, created
for the purpose. In 1832 the restriction as to engaging in trade
was withdrawn, except as regards salaried members of the British
consular service.</p>

<p>The duty of consuls, under the &ldquo;General Instructions to
British Consuls,&rdquo; is to advise His Majesty&rsquo;s trading subjects,
to quiet their differences, and to conciliate as much as possible
the subjects of the two countries. Treaty rights he is to support
in a mild and moderate spirit; and he is to check as far as
possible evasions by British traders of the local revenue laws.
Besides assisting British subjects who are tried for offences in
the local courts, and ascertaining the humanity of their treatment
after sentence, he has to consider whether home or foreign
law is more appropriate to the case, having regard to the convenience
of witnesses and the time required for decision; and,
where local courts have wrongfully interfered, he puts the
home government in motion through the consul-general or
ambassador. He sends in reports on the labour, manufacture,
trade, commercial legislation and finance, technical education,
exhibitions and conferences of the country or district in which
he resides, and, generally, furnishes information on any subject
which may be desired of him. He acts as a notary public; he
draws up marine and commercial protests, attests documents
brought to him, and, if necessary, draws up wills, powers of
attorney, or conveyances. He celebrates marriages in accordance
with the provisions of the Foreign Marriage Act 1892, and,
where the ministrations of a clergyman cannot be obtained,
reads the burial service. At a seaport he has certain duties
to perform in connexion with the navy. In the absence of any
of His Majesty&rsquo;s ships he is senior naval officer; he looks after
men left behind as stragglers, or in hospital or prison, and sends
them on in due course to the nearest ship. He is also empowered
by statute to advance for the erection or maintenance
of Anglican churches, hospitals, and places of interment sums
equal to the amount subscribed for the purpose by the resident
British subjects.</p>

<p>As the powers and duties of consuls vary with the particular
commercial interests they have to protect, and the civilization
of the state in whose territory they reside, instead of abstract
definition, we summarize the provisions on this subject of the
British Merchant Shipping Acts.<a name="FnAnchor_4c" href="#Footnote_4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Consuls are bound to send
to the Board of Trade such reports or returns on any matter
relating to British merchant shipping or seamen as they may
think necessary. Where a consul suspects that the shipping or
navigation laws are being evaded, he may require the owner or
master to produce the log-book or other ship documents (such
as the agreement with the seamen, the account of the crew, the
certificate of registration); he may muster the crew, and order
explanations with regard to the documents. Where an offence
has been committed on the high seas, or aboard ashore, by
British seamen or apprentices, the consul makes inquiry on oath,
and may send home the offender and witnesses by a British ship,
particulars for the Board of Trade being endorsed on the agreement
for conveyance. He is also empowered to detain a foreign
ship the master or seamen of which appear to him through their
misconduct or want of skill to have caused injury to a British
vessel, until the necessary application for satisfaction or security
be made to the local authorities. Every British mercantile
ship, not carrying passengers, on entering a port gives into the
custody of the consul to be endorsed by him the seamen&rsquo;s agreement,
the certificate of registry, and the official log-book; a
failure to do this is reported to the registrar-general of seamen.
The following five provisions are also made for the protection of
seamen. If a British master engage seamen at a foreign port,
the engagement is sanctioned by the consul, acting as a superintendent
of Mercantile Marine Offices. The consul collects the
property (including arrears of wages) of British seamen or
apprentices dying abroad, and remits to H.M. paymaster-general.
He also provides for the subsistence of seamen who are shipwrecked,
discharged, or left behind, even if their service was with
foreign merchants; they are generally sent home in the first
British ship that happens to be in want of a complement, and
the expenses thus incurred form a charge on the parliamentary
fund for the relief of distressed seamen, the consul receiving a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>22</span>
commission of 2½% on the amount disbursed. Complaints by
crews as to the quality and quantity of the provisions on board
are investigated by the consul, who enters a statement in the
log-book and reports to the Board of Trade. Money disbursed
by consuls on account of the illness or injury of seamen is generally
recoverable from the owner. With regard to passenger vessels,
the master is bound to give the consul facilities for inspection
and for communication with passengers, and to exhibit his
&ldquo;master&rsquo;s list,&rdquo; or list of passengers, so that the consul may
transmit to the registrar-general, for insertion in the Marine
Register Book, a report of the passengers dying and children
born during the voyage. The consul may even defray the
expenses of maintaining, and forwarding to their destination,
passengers taken off or picked up from wrecked or injured
vessels, if the master does not undertake to proceed in six weeks;
these expenses becoming, in terms of the Passenger Acts 1855
and 1863, a debt due to His Majesty from the owner or charterer,
where a salvor is justified in detaining a British vessel, the
master may obtain leave to depart by going with the salvor
before the consul, who, after hearing evidence as to the service
rendered and the proportion of ship&rsquo;s value and freight
claimed, fixes the amount for which the master is to give
bond and security. In the case of a foreign wreck the consul
is held to be the agent of the foreign owner. Much of the
notarial business which is imposed on consuls, partly by
statute and partly by the request of private parties, consists
in taking the declarations as to registry, transfers, &amp;c., under
the Mercantile Shipping Acts. Consuls in the Ottoman empire,
China, Siam and Korea have extensive judicial and executive
powers.</p>

<p>Since the incorporation of the British consular service in the
civil service there have been several proposals to &ldquo;reform&rdquo; the
system with the view of increasing its usefulness, more particularly
from the point of view of providing assistance to British trade
abroad (see <i>Reports of Special Committees of the House of
Commons on the Consular Service</i>, 1858, 1872, 1903). It has been
frequently urged that British consuls in their commercial knowledge
and intercourse with foreign merchants compare unfavourably,
for example, with the consuls of the United States. It
must be remembered, however, that there are points of striking
dissimilarity between the duties of the consuls of these two
countries. The American consul is necessarily brought much
into touch with the trade and commerce of the country to which
he is assigned through the system of consular invoices (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ad Valorem</a></span>); in his ordinary reports he is not confined to one
stereotyped form, and when preparing special reports (a valuable
feature of the United States consular service) he is liberally
treated as regards any expense to which he has been put
in obtaining information. He is practically free from the
multifarious duties which the English consul has to discharge in
connexion with the mercantile marine, nor has he to perform
marriage ceremonies; and financially he is much better off,
being allowed to retain as personal all fees obtained from his
notarial duties. The Committee of 1903 was appointed to inquire,
<i>inter alia</i>, whether the limits of age&mdash;25 to 50&mdash;for candidates
should be altered, and whether service as a vice-consul
for a certain period should be required to qualify for promotion
to the rank of consul; whether means could not be adopted to
give consular officers opportunities of increasing their practical
knowledge of commercial matters and to bring them more into
personal contact with the commercial community. The suggestions
of the committee as the result of its inquiries were adopted
in principle by the Foreign Office. The consular service is now
grouped into three main divisions: (1) the general service; (2)
Levant and Persia; and (3) China, Japan, Korea and Siam.
The general consular service is graded into three divisions:
first grade, consuls-general, salary £1000 with local allowances;
second grade, consuls-general and consuls, salary £800 and local
allowances; third grade, consuls, salary £600, with local
allowances. Vice-consuls have an annual salary of £350, rising
by annual increments of £15 to £450. In the general consular
service appointments are sometimes made to the higher offices
from the ranks, but more usually from a select list of nominees,
who must pass a qualifying examination. A proportion of the
vacancies are reserved for competition amongst candidates who
have had actual commercial experience. Divisions 2 and 3 are
recruited by open competition. There were at one time a small
number of commercial agents whose business consisted in watching
and reporting on the commerce, industries and products of
special districts, and in answering inquiries on commercial subjects.
Their duties were subsequently transferred to the consular
staff, and a new class of officers, consular attachés, created.
The consular attachés divide their time between special investigations
abroad, and visits to manufacturing districts in
the United Kingdom. The headquarters of the commercial
attachés in Europe, except those at Paris and Constantinople,
were transferred to London, without defined districts, in 1907
(see <i>Report on the System of British Commercial Attachés and
Agents</i>, 1908, Cd. 3610). &ldquo;Pro-consuls&rdquo; are frequently appointed
for the purpose of administering oaths, taking affidavits or
affirmations, and performing notarial acts under the Commissioners
for Oaths Acts 1889.</p>

<p>The position of the United States consuls is minutely described
in the Regulations, Washington, 1896. Under various treaties
and conventions they enjoy large privileges and jurisdiction.
By the treaty of 1816 with Sweden the United States government
agreed that the consuls of the two states respectively should be
sole judges in disputes between captains and crews of vessels.
(Up to 1906 there were eighteen treaties containing this clause.)
By convention with France in 1853 they likewise agreed that the
consuls of both countries should be permitted to hold real estate,
and to have the &ldquo;police interne des navires à commerce.&rdquo; In
Borneo, China, Korea, Morocco, Persia, Siam, Tripoli and Turkey
an extensive jurisdiction, civil and criminal, is exercised by
treaty stipulation in cases where United States subjects are
interested. Exemption from liability to appear as a witness is
often stipulated. The question was raised in France in 1843 by
the case of the Spanish consul Soller at Aix, and in America in
1854 by the case of Dillon, the French consul at San Francisco,
who, on being arrested by Judge Hoffmann for declining to give
evidence in a criminal suit, pulled down his consular flag. So,
also, inviolability of national archives is often stipulated. To
the consuls of other nations the United States government have
always accorded the privileges of arresting deserters, and of being
themselves amenable only to the Federal and not to the States
courts. They also recognize foreign consuls as representative
suitors for absent foreigners.</p>

<p>The United States commercial agents are appointed by the
president, and usually receive an <i>exequatur</i>. They form a class
by themselves, and are distinct from the consular agents, who
are simply deputy consuls in districts where there is no principal
consul.</p>

<p>By a law of April 1906 the U.S. consular service was reorganized
and graded, the office of consul-general being divided
into seven classes, and that of consul into nine classes; and on
June 27 an executive order was issued by President Roosevelt
governing appointments and promotions.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1c" href="#FnAnchor_1c"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The title of consul was borne by the chief municipal officers of
several cities of the south of France during the middle ages and up
to the Revolution. The name was not due to their being the successors
of the chiefs of the Roman <i>municipia</i>. They were members
of the governing body known as the <i>consulat</i>, and in Latin documents
are sometimes styled <i>consiliarii</i>, i.e. councillors. The <i>consulat</i> itself
is not traceable beyond the 12th century.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2c" href="#FnAnchor_2c"><span class="fn">2</span></a> Particular quarters of mercantile cities were assigned to foreign
traders and were placed under the jurisdiction of their own magistrates,
variously styled syndics, provosts (<i>praepositi</i>), échevins
(<i>scabini</i>), &amp;c., who had power to fine or to expel from the quarter.
The <a href="#artlinks">Hanseatic League</a> (q.v.), particularly, had numerous settlements
of this kind, the earliest being the Steelyard at London, established
in the 13th century.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3c" href="#FnAnchor_3c"><span class="fn">3</span></a> i.e. as regards the organization of the system. Consuls, or
consuls-general, of other countries have sometimes a diplomatic or
quasi-diplomatic status. Consuls-general chargés d&rsquo;affaires, e.g.,

agent and consul-general in Egypt, whose position is unique. The
diplomatic agent of Belgium at Buenos Aires, e.g., is minister-resident
and consul-general, and the minister of Ecuador in London is consul-general
chargé d&rsquo;affaires.</p>

<p><span class="bold">&ldquo;CONSULATE OF THE SEA,&rdquo;</span> a celebrated collection of
maritime customs and ordinances (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sea Laws</a></span>) in the
Catalan language, published at Barcelona in the latter part of
the 15th century. Its proper title is <i>The Book of the Consulate</i>,
or in Catalan, <i>Lo Libre de Consolat</i>, the name being derived from
the fact that it embodied the rules of law followed in the maritime
cities of the Mediterranean coast by the commercial judges
known generally as <a href="#artlinks">consuls</a> (q.v.). The earliest extant edition
of the work, which was printed at Barcelona in 1494, is without
a title-page or frontispiece, but it is described by the above-mentioned
title in the epistle dedicatory prefixed to the table
of contents. The only known copy of this edition is preserved in
the National Library in Paris. The epistle dedicatory states
that the work is an amended version of the <i>Book of the Consulate</i>,
compiled by Francis Celelles with the assistance of numerous
shipmasters and merchants well versed in maritime affairs.
According to a statement made by Capmany in his <i>Codigo de los
costumbras maritimas de Barcelona</i>, published at Madrid in 1791,
there was extant to his knowledge in the last century a more
ancient edition of the <i>Book of the Consulate</i>, printed in semi-Gothic
characters, which he believed to be of a date prior to 1484.
This is the earliest period to which any historical record of the
<i>Book of the Consulate</i> being in print can be traced back. There
are, however, two Catalan MSS. preserved in the National Library
in Paris, the earliest of which, being MS. Espagnol 124, contains
the two first treatises which are printed in the <i>Book of the Consulate</i>
of 1494, and which are the most ancient portion of its
contents, written in a hand of the 14th century, on paper of that
century. The subsequent parts of this MS. are on paper of the
15th century, but there is no document of a date more recent
than 1436. The later of the two MSS., being MS. Espagnol 56,
is written throughout on paper of the 15th century, and in a hand
of that century, and it purports, from a certificate on the face of
the last leaf, to have been executed under the superintendence
of Peter Thomas, a notary public, and the scribe of the Consulate
of the Sea at Barcelona.</p>

<p>The edition of 1494, which is justly regarded as the <i>editio
princeps</i> of the <i>Book of the Consulate</i>, contains, in the first place,
a code of procedure issued by the kings of Aragon for the guidance
of the courts of the consuls of the sea, in the second place, a
collection of ancient customs of the sea, and thirdly, a body of
ordinances for the government of cruisers of war. A colophon
at the end of these ordinances informs the readers that &ldquo;the book
commonly called the <i>Book of the Consulate</i> ends here&rdquo;; after
which there follows a document known by the title of <i>The
Acceptations</i>, which purports to record that the previous chapters
and ordinances had been approved by the Roman people in the
11th century, and by various princes and peoples in the 12th and
13th centuries. Capmany was the first person to question the
authenticity of this document in his <i>Memorias historicas sobre
la marina, &amp;c., de Barcelona</i>, published at Madrid in 1779-1792.
Pardessus and other writers on maritime law followed up the
inquiry in the 19th century, and have conclusively shown that
the document, whatever may have been its origin, has no proper
reference to the <i>Book of the Consulate</i>, and is, in fact, of no historical
value whatsoever. The paging of the edition of 1494 ceases
with this document, at the end of which is the printer&rsquo;s colophon,
reciting that &ldquo;the work was completed on the 14th of July 1494,
at Barcelona, by Père Posa, priest and printer.&rdquo; The remainder
of the volume consists of what may be regarded as an appendix
to the original <i>Book of the Consulate</i>. This appendix contains
various maritime ordinances of the kings of Aragon and of the
councillors of the city of Barcelona, ranging over a period from
1340 to 1484. It is printed apparently in the same type with the
preceding part of the volume. The original <i>Book of the Consulate</i>,
coupled with this appendix, constitutes the work which has
obtained general circulation in Europe under the title of <i>The Consulate
of the Sea</i>, and which in the course of the 16th century was
translated into the Castilian, the Italian, and the French
languages. The Italian translation, printed at Venice in 1549
by Jean Baptista Pedrezano, was the version which obtained
the largest circulation in the north of Europe, and led many
jurists to suppose the work to have been of Italian origin. In
the next following century the work was translated into Dutch
by Westerven, and into German by Engelbrecht, and it is also
said to have been translated into Latin.</p>

<div class="condenced">
<p>An excellent translation into French of &ldquo;The Customs of the Sea,&rdquo;
which are the most valuable portion of the <i>Book of the Consulate</i>, was
published by Pardessus in the second volume of his <i>Collection des
lois maritimes</i> (Paris, 1834), under the title of &ldquo;La Compilation
connue sous le nom de consulat de la mer.&rdquo; See introduction, by Sir
Travers Twiss, to the <i>Black Book of the Admiralty</i> (London, 1874),

<p><span class="bold">CONSUMPTION</span> (Lat. <i>consumere</i>), literally, the act of consuming
or destroying. Thus the word is popularly applied to
phthisis, a &ldquo;wasting away&rdquo; of the lungs due to <a href="#artlinks">tuberculosis</a>
(q.v.). In economics the word has a special significance as a
technical term. It has been defined as the destruction of utilities,
and thus opposed to &ldquo;production,&rdquo; which is the creation of
utilities, a utility in this connexion being anything which satisfies
a desire or serves a purpose. Consumption may be either productive
or unproductive; productive where it is a means directly
or indirectly to the satisfaction of any economic want, unproductive
when it is devoted to pleasures or luxuries. Its place in
the science of economics, and its close relation with production,
are treated of in every text-book, but special reference may be
made to W. Roscher, <i>Nationalökonomie</i>, 1883, and G. Schönberg,
<i>Handbuch d. polit. Ökonomie</i>, 1890-1891.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONSUS,</span> an ancient Italian deity, originally a god of agriculture.
The time at which his festival was held (after harvest
and seed-sowing), the nature of its ceremonies and amusements,
his altar at the end of the Circus Maximus always covered with
earth except on such occasions, all point to his connexion with
the earth. In accordance with this, the name has been derived
from <i>condere</i> (= Condius, as the &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; of grain or the
&ldquo;hidden&rdquo; god, whose life-producing influence works in the
depths of the earth). Another etymology is from <i>conserere</i>
(&ldquo;sow,&rdquo; cf. Ops Consiva and her festival Opiconsivia). Amongst
the ancients (Livy i. 9; Dion. Halic. ii. 31) Census was most
commonly identified with <span class="grk" title="Poseidôn Hippios">&#928;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#8182;&#957; &#8158;&#921;&#960;&#960;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> (Neptunus Equester),
and in later Latin poets Consus is used for Neptunus, but this
idea was due to the horse and chariot races which took place at
his festival; otherwise, the two deities have nothing in common.
According to another view, he was the god of good counsel,
who was said to have &ldquo;advised&rdquo; Romulus to carry off the
Sabine women (Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, iii. 199) when they visited Rome
for the first celebration of his festival (Consualia). In later
times, with the introduction of Greek gods into the Roman
theological system, Consus, who had never been the object of
special reverence, sank to the level of a secondary deity, whose
character was rather abstract and intellectual.</p>

<p>His festival was celebrated on the  of August and the
15th of December. On the former date, the flamen Quirinalis,
assisted by the vestals, offered sacrifice, and the pontifices
presided at horse and chariot races in the circus. It was a day
of public rejoicing; all kinds of rustic amusements took place,
amongst them running on ox-hides rubbed with oil (like the
Gr. <span class="grk" title="haskoliasmos">&#7936;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>). Horses and mules, crowned with garlands,
were given rest from work. A special feature of the games in
the circus was chariot racing, in which mules, as the oldest
draught beasts, took the place of horses. The origin of these
games was generally attributed to Romulus; but by some
they were considered an imitation of the Arcadian <span class="grk" title="hippokrateia">&#7985;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>
introduced by Evander. There was a sanctuary of Consus on
the Aventine, dedicated by L. Papirius Cursor in 272, in early
times wrongly identified with the altar in the circus.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTANGO,</span> a Stock Exchange term for the rate of interest
paid by a &ldquo;bull&rdquo; who has bought stock for the rise and does

arranges to carry over or continue his bargain, and does so by
entering into a fresh bargain with his seller, or some other party,

by which he sells the stock for the Settlement and buys it again

<p><span class="bold">CONTARINI,</span> the name of a distinguished Venetian family,
who gave to the republic eight doges and many other eminent
citizens. The story of their descent from the Roman family
of Cotta, appointed prefects of the Reno valley (whence Cotta
Reni or Conti del Reno), is probably a legend. One Mario Contarini
was among the twelve electors of the doge Paulo Lucio
Anafesto in 697. Domenico Contarini, elected doge in 1043,
subjugated rebellious Dalmatia and recaptured Grado from the
patriarch of Aquileia. He died in 1070. Jacopo was doge
from 1275 to 1280. Andrea was elected doge in 1367, and during
his reign the war of Chioggia took place (1380); he was the
first to melt down his plate and mortgage his property for the
benefit of the state. Other Contarini doges were: Francesco
(1623-1624), Niccolò (1630-1631), who built the church of the
Salute, Carlo (1655-1656), during whose reign the Venetians
gained the naval victory of the Dardanelles, Domenico (1659-1675)
and Alvise (1676-1684). There were at one time no less
than eighteen branches of the family; one of the most important
was that of Contarini dallo Zaffo or di Giaffa, who had been
invested with the countship of Jaffa in Syria for their services to
Caterina Cornaro, queen of Cyprus; another was that of Contarini
degli Scrigni (of the coffers), so called on account of their
great wealth. Many members of the family distinguished
themselves in the service of the republic, in the wars against the
Turks, and no less than seven Contarini fought at Lepanto.
One Andrea Contarini was beheaded in 1430 for having wounded
the doge <a href="#artlinks">Francesco Foscari</a> (q.v.) on the nose. Other members
of the house were famous as merchants, prelates and men of
letters; among these we may mention Cardinal Gasparo Contarini
(1483-1542), and Marco Contarini (1631-1689), who was
celebrated as a patron of music and collected at his villa of
Piazzola a large number of valuable musical MSS., now in the
Marciana library at Venice. The family owned many palaces in
various parts of Venice, and several streets still bear its name.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTAT, LOUISE FRANÇOISE</span> (1760-1813), French actress,
made her <i>début</i> at the Comédie Française in 1766 as Atalide in
<i>Bajazet</i>. It was in comedy, however, that she made her first
success, as Suzanne in Beaumarchais&rsquo;s <i>Mariage de Figaro</i>; and
in several minor character parts, which she raised to the first
importance, and as the soubrette in the plays of Molière and
Marivaux, she found opportunities exactly fitted to her talents.
She retired in 1809 and married de Parny, nephew of the poet.
Her sister Marie Émilie Contat (1769-1846), an admirable
soubrette, especially as the pert servant drawn by Molière and
de Regnard, made her <i>début</i> in 1784, and retired in 1815.</p>

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CONTE,</span> literally a &ldquo;story,&rdquo; derived from the Fr. <i>conter</i>, to
narrate, through low Lat. and Provençal forms <i>contare</i> and
<i>comtar</i>. This word, although not recognized by the <i>New English
Dictionary</i> as an English term, is yet so frequently used in
English literary criticisms that some definition of it seems to be
demanded. A <i>conte</i>, in French, differs from a <i>récit</i> or a <i>rapport</i>
in the element of style; it may be described as an anecdote told
with deliberate art, and in this introduction of art lies its peculiar
literary value. According to Littré, there is no fundamental
difference between a <i>conte</i> and a <i>roman</i>, and all that can be said
is that the <i>conte</i> is the generic term, covering long stories and
short alike, whereas the <i>roman</i> (or novel) must extend to a
certain length. But if this is the primitive and correct signification
of the word, it is certain that modern criticism thinks of a
<i>conte</i> essentially as a short story, and as a short story exclusively
occupied in illustrating one set of ideas or one disposition of
character. As early as the 13th century, the word is used in
French literature to describe an anecdote thus briefly and
artistically told, in prose or verse. The fairy-tales of Perrault
and the apologues of La Fontaine were alike spoken of as <i>contes</i>,
and stories of peculiar extravagance were known as <i>contes bleus</i>,
because they were issued to the common public in coarse blue
paper covers. The most famous <i>contes</i> in the 18th century were
those of Voltaire, who has been described as having invented
the <i>conte philosophique</i>. But those brilliant stories, <i>Candide</i>,
<i>Zadig</i>, <i>L&rsquo;Ingénu</i>, <i>La Princess de Babylone</i> and <i>Le Taureau blanc</i>,
are not, in the modern sense, <i>contes</i> at all. The longer of these
are <i>romans</i>, the shorter <i>nouvelles</i>, not one has the anecdotical
unity required by a <i>conte</i>. The same may be said of those of
Marmontel, and of the insipid imitations of Oriental fancy which
were so popular at the close of the 18th century. The most perfect
recent writer of <i>contes</i> is certainly Guy de Maupassant, and
his celebrated anecdote called &ldquo;Boule de suif&rdquo; may be taken
as an absolutely perfect example of this class of literature, the
precise limitations of which it is difficult to define.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTÉ, NICOLAS JACQUES</span> (1755-1805), French mechanical
genius, chemist and painter, was born at Aunou-sur-Orne, near
Sées, on the 4th of August 1755, of a family of poor farm labourers.
At the age of fourteen he displayed precocious artistic talent
in a series of religious panels, remarkably fine in colour and
composition, for the principal hospital of Sées, where he was
employed to help the gardener. With the advice of Greuze he
took up portrait painting, quickly became the fashion, and laid
by in a few years a fair competency. From that time he gave free
rein to his passion for the mechanical arts and scientific studies.
He attended the lectures of J. A. C. Charles, L. N. Vaquelin and
J. B. Leroy, and exhibited before the Academy of Science an
hydraulic machine of his own invention of which the model was
the subject of a flattering report, and was placed in Charles&rsquo;s
collection. The events of the Revolution soon gave him an
opportunity for a further display of his inventive faculty. The
war with England deprived France of plumbago; he substituted
for it an artificial substance obtained from a mixture of graphite
and clay, and took out a patent in 1795 for the form of pencil
which still bears his name. At this time he was associated with
Monge and Berthollet in experiments in connexion with the
inflation of military balloons, was conducting the school for that
department of the engineer corps at Meudon, was perfecting the
methods of producing hydrogen in quantity, and was appointed
(1796) by the Directory to the command of all the aerostatic
establishments. He was at the head of the newly created
Conservatoire des arts et métiers, and occupied himself with
experiments in new compositions of permanent colours, and in
1798 constructed a metal-covered barometer for measuring
comparative heights, by observing the weight of mercury
issuing from the tube. Summoned by Bonaparte to take part
as chief of the aerostatic corps in the expedition to Egypt, he
considerably extended his field of activity, and for three years
and a half was, to quote Berthollet, &ldquo;the soul of the colony.&rdquo;
The disaster of Aboukir and the revolt of Cairo had caused the
loss of the greater part of the instruments and munitions taken
out by the French. Conté, who, as Monge says, &ldquo;had every
science in his head and every art in his hands,&rdquo; and whom the
First Consul described as &ldquo;good at everything,&rdquo; seemed to be
everywhere at once and triumphed over apparently insurmountable
difficulties. He made, in an almost uncivilized
country, utensils, tools and machinery of every sort from simple
windmills to stamps for minting coin. Thanks to his activity
and genius, the expedition was provided with bread, cloth, arms
and munitions of war; the engineers with the exact tools of
their trade; the surgeons with operating instruments. He
made the designs, built the models, organized and supervised
the manufacture, and seemed to be able to invent immediately
anything required. On his return to France in 1802 he was
commissioned by the minister of the interior, Chaptal, to superintend
the publication of the great work of the commission on
Egypt, and an engraving machine of his construction materially
shortened this task, which, however, he did not live to see
finished. He died at Paris on the 6th of December 1805.
Napoleon had included him in his first promotions to the Legion
of Honour. A bronze statue was erected to his memory in 1852
at Sées, by public subscription.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTEMPT OF COURT,</span> in English law, any disobedience
or disrespect to the authority or privileges of a legislative body,
or interference with the administration of a court of justice.</p>

<p>1. <i>The High Court of Parliament.</i> Each of the two houses
of Parliament has by the law and custom of parliament power
to protect its freedom, dignity and authority against insult,
disregard or violence by resort to its own process and not to
ordinary courts of law and without having its process interfered
with by those courts. The nature and limits of this authority
to punish for contempt have been the subject of not infrequent
conflict with the courts of law, from the time when Lord Chief
Justice Holt threatened to commit the speaker for attempting
to stop the trial of <i>Ashby</i> v. <i>White</i> (1701), as a breach of privilege,
to the cases of <i>Burdett</i> v. <i>Abbott</i> (1810), <i>Stockdale</i> v. <i>Hansard</i>
and <i>Howard</i> v. <i>Gosset</i> (1842, 1843), and <i>Bradlaugh</i> v. <i>Gosset</i>
(1834). It is now the accepted view that the power of either
House to punish contempt is exceptional and derived from
ancient usage, and does not flow from their being courts of
record. Orders for committal by the Commons are effectual
only while the House sits; orders by the Lords may be for a
time specified, in which event prorogation does not operate as
a discharge of the offender. It was at one time considered that
the privilege of committing for contempt was inherent in every
deliberative body invested with authority by the constitution,
and consequently that colonial legislative bodies had by the
nature of their functions the power to commit for contempt.
But in <i>Kielley</i> v. <i>Carson</i> (1843; 4 Moore, P.C. 63) it was held
that the power belonged to parliament by ancient usage only
and not on the theory above stated, and in each colony it is
necessary to inquire how far the colonial legislature has acquired,
by order in council or charter or from the imperial legislature,
power to punish breach of privilege by imprisonment or committal
for contempt. This power has in some cases been given
directly, in others by authority to make laws and regulations
under sanctions like those enforced by the Houses of the imperial
parliament. In the case of Nova Scotia the provincial assembly
has power to give itself by statute authority to commit
for contempt (<i>Fielding</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>, 1896; L.R.A.C. 600). In
<i>Barton</i> v. <i>Taylor</i> (1886; 11 A.C. 197) the competence of the
legislative assembly of New South Wales to make standing
orders punishing contempt was recognized to exist under the
colonial constitution, but the particular standing orders under
consideration are held not to cover the acts which had been
punished. (See May, <i>Parl. Pr.</i>, 10th ed., 1896; Anson, <i>Law
and Custom of the Constitution</i>, 3rd ed., 1897.)</p>

<p>2. <i>Courts of Justice.</i> The term contempt of court, when used
with reference to the courts or persons to whom the exercise
of the judicial functions of the crown has been delegated, means
insult offered to such court or person by deliberate defiance of
its authority, disobedience to its orders, interruption of its
proceedings or interference with the due course of justice, or
any conduct calculated or tending to bring the authority or
administration of the law into disrespect or disregard, or to
interfere with or prejudice parties or witnesses during the
litigation. The ingenuity of the judges and of those who are
concerned to defeat or defy justice have rendered contempt
almost Protean in its character. But for practical purposes
most, if not all, contempts fall within the classification which
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) Disobedience to the judgment or order of a court commanding
the doing or abstaining from a particular act, e.g. an
order to execute a conveyance of property or an order on a
person in a fiduciary capacity to pay into court trust moneys
as to which he is an accounting party. This includes disobedience
by the members of a local authority to a <i>mandamus</i> to do some
act which they are by law bound to do; and proceedings for
contempt have been taken in the case of guardians of the poor
who have refused to enforce the Vaccination Acts, e.g. at
Keighley and Leicester, and of town councillors who have
refused to comply with an order to take specified measures to
drain their borough (e.g. Worcester). This process for compelling
obedience is in substance a process of civil execution for the
benefit of the injured party rather than a criminal process for
punishing the disobedience; and for purposes of appeal orders
dealing with these forms of contempt have hitherto been treated
as civil proceedings.</p>

<p>(b) Disobedience by inferior judges or magistrates to the
lawful order of a superior court. Such disobedience, if amounting
to wilful misconduct, would usually give ground for amotion
or removal from office, or for prosecution or indictment or
information for misconduct (Archbold, <i>Criminal Pleading</i>, 147,
23rd ed.).</p>

<p>(c) Disobedience or misconduct by executive officers of the
law, e.g. sheriffs and their bailiffs or gaolers. The contempt
consists in not complying with the terms of writs or warrants
sent for execution. For instance, a judge of assize having
ordered the court to be cleared on account of some disturbance,
the high sheriff issued a placard protesting against &ldquo;this unlawful
proceeding,&rdquo; and &ldquo;prohibiting his officer from aiding
and abetting any attempt to bar out the public from free access
to the court.&rdquo; The lord chief justice of England, sitting in the
other court, summoned the sheriff before him and fined him
£500 for the contempt, and £500 more for persisting in addressing
the grand jury in court, after he had been ordered to desist.
A sheriff who fails to attend the assizes is liable to severe fine
as being in contempt (Oswald, 51). And in Harvey&rsquo;s case
(1884, 26 Ch. D. 644) steps were taken to attach a sheriff who
had failed to execute a writ of attachment for contempt of court
in the mistaken belief that he was not entitled to break open
doors to take the person in contempt. The Sheriffs Act 1887
enumerates many instances in which misconduct is punishable
under that act, but reserves to superior courts of record power
to deal with such misconduct as a contempt (s. 29).</p>

<p>(d) Misconduct or neglect of duty by subordinate officials
of courts of justice, including solicitors. In these cases it is
more usual for the superior authorities to remove the offender
from office, or for disciplinary proceedings to be instituted by
the Law Society. But in the case of an unqualified person
assuming to act as a solicitor or in the case of breach of an
undertaking given by a solicitor to the court, proceedings for
contempt are still taken.</p>

<p>(e) Misconduct by parties, jurors or witnesses. Jurors who
fail to attend in obedience to a jury summons and witnesses
who fail to attend on subpoena are liable to punishment for
contempt, and parties, counsel or solicitors who practise a
fraud on the court are similarly liable.</p>

<p>(f) Contempt in <i>facie curiae</i>. &ldquo;Some contempts,&rdquo; says
Blackstone, &ldquo;may arise in the face of the court, as by rude
and contumelious behaviour, by obstinacy, perverseness or
prevarication, by breach of the peace, or any wilful disturbance
whatever&rdquo;; in other words, direct insult to or interference
with a sitting court is treated as contempt of the court. It is
immaterial whether the offender is juror, party, witness, counsel,
solicitor or a stranger to the case at hearing, and occasionally
it is found necessary to punish for contempt persons under
trial for felony or misdemeanour if by violent language or conduct
they interrupt the proceedings at their trial. Judges have even
treated as contempt the continuance outside the court-house
after warning of a noise sufficient to disturb the proceedings
of the court; and in Victoria Chief Justice Higginbotham
committed for contempt a builder who persisted after warning
in building operations close to the central criminal court in
Melbourne, which interfered with the due conduct of the business
of the sittings.</p>

<p>(g) Attempts to prevent or interfere with the due course
of justice, whether made by a person interested in a particular
case or by an outsider. This branch of contempt takes many
forms, such as frauds on the court by justices, solicitors or counsel
(e.g. by fraudulently circularizing shareholders of a company
against which a winding-up petition had been filed), tampering
with witnesses by inducing them through threats or persuasion
not to attend or to withhold evidence or to commit perjury,
threatening judge or jury or attempting to bribe them and the
like; and also by &ldquo;scandalizing the court itself&rdquo; by abusing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>26</span>
the parties concerned in a pending case, or by creating prejudice
against such persons before their cause is heard.</p>

<p>The <i>locus classicus</i> on the subject of contempt by attacks
on judges is a judgment prepared by Sir Eardley-Wilmot in the
case of an application for an attachment against
<span class="sidenote">Invectives against judges.</span>
J. Almon in 1765, for publishing a pamphlet libelling
the court of king&rsquo;s bench. The judgment was not
actually delivered as the case was settled, but has long
been accepted as correctly stating the law. Sir Eardley-Wilmot
said that the offence of libelling judges in their judicial capacity
is the most proper case for an attachment, for the &ldquo;arraignment
of the justice of the judges is arraigning the king&rsquo;s justice; it
is an impeachment of his wisdom and goodness in the choice of
his judges; and excites in the minds of the people a general
dissatisfaction with all judicial determinations, and indisposes
their minds to obey them. To be impartial, and <i>to be universally
thought</i> so, are both absolutely necessary for the giving justice
that free, open and uninterrupted current which it has for many
ages found all over this kingdom, and which so eminently
distinguishes and exalts it above all nations upon the earth.&rdquo;
Again, &ldquo;the constitution has provided very apt and proper
remedies for correcting and rectifying the involuntary mistakes
of judges, and for punishing and removing them for any perversion
of justice. But if their authority is to be trampled on by
pamphleteers and news-writers, and the people are to be told
that the power given to the judges for their protection is prostituted
to their destruction, the court may retain its power some
little time, but I am sure it will eventually lose all its authority.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The object of the discipline enforced by the court by proceedings
for contempt of court is not now, if it ever was, to vindicate
the personal dignity of the judges or to protect them from
insult as individuals, but to vindicate the dignity and authority
of the court itself and to prevent acts tending to obstruct the
due course of justice. The question whether a personal invective
against judges should be dealt with <i>brevi manu</i> by the court
attacked, or by proceedings at the instance of the attorney-general
by information or indictment for a libel on the administration
of justice or on the judge attacked, or should be dealt
with by a civil action for damages, depends on the nature and
occasion of the attack on the judge.</p>

<p>There has at times been a disposition by judges in colonial
courts to use the process of the court to punish criticisms on
their acts by counsel or parties or even outsiders, which the
privy council has been prone to discourage. For instance in a
Nova Scotia case a barrister was suspended from practice for
writing to the chief justice of the province a letter relating to
a case in which the barrister was suitor. The privy council
while considering the letter technically a contempt, held the
punishment inappropriate. In <i>Macleod</i> v. <i>St Aubyn</i> (1899,
A.C. 549) it was said that proceedings for scandalizing the
court itself were obsolete in England. But in 1900 the king&rsquo;s
bench division, following the Almon case, summarily punished
a scurrilous personal attack on a judge of assize with reference
to his remarks in a concluded ease, published immediately after
the conclusion of the case (<i>R.</i> v. <i>Gray</i>, 1900, 2 Q.B. 36). The
same measure may be meted out to those who publish invectives
against judges or juries with the object of creating suspicion
or contempt as to the administration of justice. But the existence
of this power does not militate against the right of the press
to publish full reports of trials and judgments or to make with
fairness, good faith, candour and decency, comments and
criticisms on what passed at the trial and on the correctness of
the verdict or the judgment. To impute corruption is said to go
beyond the limits of fair criticism. Shortt (<i>Law relating to
Works of Literature</i>) states the law to be that the temperate and
respectful discussion of judicial determination is not prohibited,
but mere invective and abuse, and still more the imputation of
false, corrupt and dishonest motives is punishable. In an
information granted in 1788 against the corporation of Yarmouth
for having entered upon their books an order &ldquo;stating that the
assembly were sensible that Mr W. (against whom an action had
been brought for malicious prosecution, and a verdict for £3000
returned, which the court refused to disturb) was actuated by
motives of public justice, of preserving the rights of the corporation
to their admiralty jurisdiction, and of supporting the honour
and credit of the chief magistrate,&rdquo; Mr Justice Butler said, &ldquo;The
judge and jury who tried the case, confirmed by the court of
common pleas, have said that instead of his having been actuated
by motives of public justice, or by any motives which should
influence the actions of an honest man, he had been actuated
by malice. These opinions are not reconcilable; if the one be
right the other must be wrong. It is therefore a direct insinuation
that the court had judged wrong in all they have done in
this case, and is therefore clearly a libel on the administration of
justice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exact limits of the power to punish for contempt of court
in respect of statements or comments on the action of judges and
juries, or with reference to <i>pending</i> proceedings, have been the
subject of some controversy, owing to the difficulty of reconciling
the claims of the press to liberty and of the public to free discussion
of the proceedings of courts of justice with the claims of
the judges to due respect and of the parties to litigation that
their causes should not be prejudiced before trial by outside interference.
As the law now stands it is permissible to publish contemporaneous
<i>reports</i> of the proceedings in cases pending in any
court (Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888, s. 3), unless the
proceedings have taken place in private (<i>in camera</i>), or the court
has in the interests of justice prohibited any report until the case
is concluded, a course now rarely, if ever, adopted. But it is not
permissible to make any comments on a pending case calculated
to interfere with the due course of justice in the case, nor to
publish statements about the cause or the parties calculated
to have that effect. This rule applies even when the case has
been tried and the jury has disagreed if a second trial is in
prospect. Applications are frequently made to commit proprietors
and editors who comment too freely or who undertake
the task of trying in their newspapers a pending case. The courts
are now slow to move unless satisfied that the statements or
comments may seriously affect the course of justice, e.g. by
reaching the jurors who have to try the case.</p>

<p>The difference between pending and decided cases has been
frequently recognized by the courts. What would be a fair
comment in a decided case may tend to influence the mind
of the judge or the jury in a case waiting to be heard, and will
accordingly be punished as a contempt. In <i>Tichborne</i> v. <i>Mostyn</i>
the publisher of a newspaper was held to have committed a
contempt by printing in his paper extracts from affidavits in a
pending suit, with comments upon them. In the case of <i>R.</i> v.
<i>Castro</i> it was held that after a true bill has been found, and the
indictment removed into the court of queen&rsquo;s bench, and a day
fixed for trial, the case was pending; and it was a contempt
of court to address public meetings, alleging that the defendant
was not guilty, that there was a conspiracy against the defendant,
and that he could not have a fair trial; and the court ordered
the parties to answer for their contempt. In the case of the Moat
Farm murder (1903) the high court punished as contempt a
series of articles published in a newspaper while the preliminary
inquiry was proceeding and before the case went to a jury
(<i>R.</i> v. <i>Parker</i>, 1903, 2 K.B. 432). The like course was followed
in 1905 in the case of statements made in a Welsh newspaper
about a woman awaiting trial for attempted murder (<i>R.</i> v.
<i>Davies</i>, 1906, 1 K.B. 32); and in the case of the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>
in 1902 (<i>R.</i> v. <i>Tibbits and Windust</i>, 1 K.B. 77), two journalists
were tried on indictment, and held to have been rightly
convicted, for conspiring to prevent the course of justice by
publishing matter calculated to interfere with the fair trial of
persons who were under accusation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the superior courts the power of committing for contempt
is inherent in their constitution, has been coeval with their
original institution and has been always exercised&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">Courts having jurisdiction.</span>
(Oswald, <i>On Contempt</i>, 3). The high court in which
these courts are merged is the only court which has
a general jurisdiction to deal summarily with all forms
of contempt. Each division of that court deals with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>27</span>
the particular contempts arising with reference to proceedings
before the division; but the king&rsquo;s bench division, in the exercise
of the supervisory authority inherited from the old court of king&rsquo;s
bench as <i>custos morum</i>, also from time to time deals with acts
constituting interference with justice in other inferior courts
whether of record or not. The nature and limits of this jurisdiction
after much discussion have been defined by decisions in 1903
and 1905 in attempts to try by newspapers cases under inquiry
by justices or awaiting trial at assizes or quarter sessions. The
exercise of this authority in the king&rsquo;s bench division, being in
a criminal cause or matter, is not the subject of appeal to any
higher court.</p>

<p>Inferior courts of record have, as a general rule, power to
punish only those contempts which are committed <i>in facie curiae</i>
or consist in disobedience to the lawful orders or judgments of
the court. For instance, a county court may summarily punish
persons who insult the judge or any officer of the court or any
juror or witness, or wilfully interrupt the proceedings, or misbehave
in the court-house (County Court Act 1888, s. 162), and
may also attack persons who having means refuse to comply
with an order to pay money, or refuse to comply with an order
to deliver up a specific chattel or disobey an injunction. A court
of quarter sessions has at common law a like power as to contempts
<i>in facie curiae</i> and is said to have power to punish its
officials for contempt in non-attendance or neglect of duty.</p>

<p>Contempt of court is a misdemeanour and is punishable by
fine and imprisonment or either at discretion. The offence may
be tried summarily, or may be prosecuted on information
<span class="sidenote">Punishment.</span>
or on indictment as was done in the case of the
<i>Weekly Dispatch</i> already mentioned. The prerogative
of pardon extends to all contempts of court which are dealt with
by a sentence of clearly punitive character; but it is doubtful
whether it extends to committals for disobedience to orders
made in aid of the execution of a civil judgment.</p>

<p>Contempt is usually dealt with summarily by the court contemned
in the case of contempt <i>in facie curiae</i>. The offender
may be instantly apprehended and without further proof or
examination fined or sent to prison. In the case of other contempts
the High Court not only can deal with contempts affecting
itself, but can also intervene summarily to protect inferior courts
from contempts. This jurisdiction was asserted and exercised
in the Moat Farm case (1903) and the <i>South Wales Post</i> case
(1905) already mentioned.</p>

<p>Except in cases of contempt <i>in facie curiae</i> evidence on oath
as to the alleged contempt must be laid before the court, and
application made for the &ldquo;committal&rdquo; or &ldquo;attachment&rdquo; of
the offender. The differences between the two modes are
technical rather than substantial.</p>

<p>The procedure for dealing with contempt of court varies
somewhat according as the contempt consists in disobeying
an order of the High Court made in a civil cause, or consists in
interference with the course of justice by persons not present in
court nor parties to the cause. In the first class of cases the court
proceeds by order of committal or giving leave to issue writ of
attachment. In either case the person said to be in contempt
must have full notice of the proposed motion and of the grounds
on which he is said to be in contempt; and the rules regulating
such proceedings must be strictly complied with (<i>R.</i> v. <i>Tuck</i>,
1906, 2 Ch. 692). In proceedings on the crown side of the king&rsquo;s
bench division it is still usual to apply in the first place for a rule
nisi for leave to attach the alleged offender who is given an
opportunity of explaining, excusing or justifying the incriminated
acts. It is essential that before punishment the alleged offender
should have had full notice as to the specific offence charged
and opportunity of answering to it. The king&rsquo;s bench procedure
is that generally used for interference with the due course of
criminal justice or disobedience to prerogative writs such as
<i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p>An order of committal is an order in execution specifying the
nature of the detention to be suffered, or the penalty to be paid.
The process of attachment merely brings the accused into court;
he is then required to answer on oath interrogatories administered
to him, so that the court may be better informed of the circumstances
of the contempt. If he can clear himself on oath he is
discharged; if he confesses the court will punish him by fine or
imprisonment, or both, at its discretion. But in very many cases
on proper apology and submission, and undertaking not to repeat
the contempt, and payment of costs, the court allows the
proceedings to drop without proceeding to fine or imprison.</p>

<p>From time to time proposals have been made to deprive the
superior courts of the power to deal summarily with contempts
not committed <i>in facie curiae</i>, and to require proceedings on
other charges for contempt to go before a jury. This distinction
has already been made in some British colonies, e.g. British
Guiana, by an ordinance of 1900 (No. 31). Recent decisions
in England have so fully defined the limits of the offence and
declared the practice of the courts that it would probably only
result in undue licence of the press if the power now carefully
and judicially exercised of dealing summarily with journalistic
interference with the ordinary course of justice were taken away
and the delay involved in submitting the case to a jury were made
inevitable. The courts now only act in clear cases, and in cases
of doubt can always send the question to a jury. The experience
of other countries makes it undesirable to part with the summary
remedy so long as it is in the hands of a trusted judicature.</p>

<div class="condenced">
<p><i>Scotland.</i>&mdash;In Scotland the courts of session and justiciary have,
at common law, and exercise the power of punishing contempt
committed during a judicial proceeding by censure, fine or imprisonment
<i>proprio motu</i> without formal proceedings or a summary complaint.
The nature of the offence is there in substance the same as
in England (see Petrie, 1889: 7 Rettie Justiciary 3; Smith, 1892:
20 Rettie Justiciary 52).</p>

<p><i>Ireland.</i>&mdash;In Ireland the law of contempt is on the same lines as in
England, but conflicts have arisen between the bench and popular
opinion, due to political and religious differences, which have led
to proposals for making juries and not judges arbiters in cases of
contempt.</p>

<p><i>British Dominions beyond Seas.</i>&mdash;The courts of most British
possessions have acquired and freely exercise the power of the court
of king&rsquo;s bench to deal summarily with contempt of court; and,
as already stated, it is not infrequently the duty of the privy council
to restrain too exuberant a vindication of the offended dignity of a
colonial court.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTI, PRINCES OF.</span> The title of prince of Conti, assumed
by a younger branch of the house of Condé, was taken from
Conti-sur-Selles, a small town about 20 m. S.W. of Amiens,
which came into the Condé family by the marriage of Louis of
Bourbon, first prince of Condé, with Eleanor de Roye in 1551.</p>

<p><span class="sc">François</span> (1558-1614), the third son of this marriage, was
given the title of marquis de Conti, and between 1581 and 1597
was elevated to the rank of a prince. Conti, who belonged to
the older faith, appears to have taken no part in the wars of
religion until 1587, when his distrust of Henry, third duke of
Guise, caused him to declare against the League, and to support
Henry of Navarre, afterwards King Henry IV. of France. In
1589 after the murder of Henry III., king of France, he was one
of the two princes of the blood who signed the declaration
recognizing Henry IV. as king, and he continued to support
Henry, although on the death of Charles cardinal de Bourbon
in 1590 he himself was mentioned as a candidate for the throne.
In 1605 Conti, whose first wife Jeanne de Cöeme, heiress of
Bonnétable, had died in 1601, married the beautiful and witty
Louise Marguerite (1574-1631), daughter of Henry duke of
Guise and Catherine of Cleves, whom, but for the influence of
his mistress Gabrielle d&rsquo;Estrées, Henry IV. would have made
his queen. Conti died in 1614. His only child Marie having
predeceased him in 1610, the title lapsed. His widow followed
the fortunes of Marie de&rsquo; Medici, from whom she received many
marks of favour, and was secretly married to François de
<a href="#artlinks">Bassompierre</a> (q.v.), who joined her in conspiring against Cardinal
Richelieu. Upon the exposure of the plot the cardinal exiled
her to her estate at Eu, near Amiens, where she died. The
princess wrote <i>Aventures de la cour de Perse</i>, in which, under the
veil of fictitious scenes and names, she tells the history of her
own time.</p>

<p>In 1629 the title of prince de Conti was revived in favour of
<span class="sc">Armand de Bourbon</span> (1629-1666), second son of Henry II. of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>28</span>
Bourbon, prince of Condé, and brother of Louis, the great
Condé. He was destined for the church and studied theology
at the university of Bourges, but although he received several
benefices he did not take orders. He played a conspicuous
part in the intrigues and fighting of the Fronde, became in 1648
commander-in-chief of the rebel army, and in 1650 was with
his brother Condé imprisoned at Vincennes. Released when
Mazarin went into exile, he wished to marry Mademoiselle de
Chevreuse (1627-1652), daughter of the famous confidante of
Anne of Austria, but was prevented by his brother, who was now
supreme in the state. He was concerned in the Fronde of 1651,
but soon afterwards became reconciled with Mazarin, and in
1654 married the cardinal&rsquo;s niece, Anne Marie Martinozzi
(1639-1672), and secured the government of Guienne. He took
command of the army which in 1654 invaded Catalonia, where
he captured three towns from the Spaniards. He afterwards
led the French forces in Italy, but after his defeat before Alessandria
in 1657 retired to Languedoc, where he devoted himself
to study and mysticism until his death. At Clermont Conti had
been a fellow student of Molière&rsquo;s for whom he secured an
introduction to the court of Louis XIV., but afterwards, when
writing a treatise against the stage entitled <i>Traité de la comédie
et des spectacles selon les traditions de l&rsquo;Église</i> (Paris, 1667), he
charged the dramatist with keeping a school of atheism. Conti
also wrote <i>Lettres sur la grâce</i>, and <i>Du devoir des grands et des
devoirs des gouverneurs de province</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Louis Armand de Bourbon</span>, prince de Conti (1661-1685),
eldest son of the preceding, succeeded his father in 1666, and in
1680 married Marie Anne, a daughter of Louis XIV. and Louise
de la Vallière. He served with distinction in Flanders in 1683,
and against the wish of the king went to Hungary, where he
assisted the Imperialists to defeat the Turks at Gran in 1683.
After a dissolute life he died at Fontainebleau from smallpox.</p>

<p><span class="sc">François Louis de Bourbon</span>, prince de Conti (1664-1709),
younger brother of the preceding, was known until 1685 as prince
de la Roche-sur-Yon. Naturally of great ability, he received
an excellent education and was distinguished both for the
independence of his mind and the popularity of his manners.
On this account he was not received with favour by Louis XIV.;
so in 1683 he assisted the Imperialists in Hungary, and while
there he wrote some letters in which he referred to Louis as <i>le
roi an théâtre</i>, for which on his return to France he was temporarily
banished to Chantilly. Conti was a favourite of his uncle the
great Condé, whose grand-daughter Marie Thérese de Bourbon
(1666-1732) he married in 1688. In 1689 he accompanied his
intimate friend Marshal Luxembourg to the Netherlands, and
shared in the French victories at Fleurus, Steinkirk and Neerwinden.
On the death of his cousin, Jean Louis Charles, duc
de Longueville (1646-1694), Conti in accordance with his
cousin&rsquo;s will, claimed the principality of Neuchâtel against
Marie, duchesse de Nemours (1625-1707), a sister of the duke.
He failed to obtain military assistance from the Swiss, and by
the king&rsquo;s command yielded the disputed territory to Marie,
although the courts of law had decided in his favour. In 1697
Louis XIV. offered him the Polish crown, and by means of
bribes the abbé de Polignac secured his election. Conti started
rather unwillingly for his new kingdom, probably, as St Simon
remarks, owing to his affection for Françoise, wife of Philip II.,
duke of Orleans, and daughter of Louis XIV. and Madame de
Montespan. When he reached Danzig and found his rival
Augustus II., elector of Saxony, already in possession of the
Polish crown, he returned to France, where he was graciously
received by Louis, although St Simon says the king was vexed
to see him again. But the misfortunes of the French armies
during the earlier years of the war of the Spanish Succession
compelled Louis to appoint Conti, whose military renown stood
very high, to command the troops in Italy. He fell ill before
he could take the field, and died on the 9th of February 1709,
his death calling forth exceptional signs of mourning from all
classes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Louis Armand de Bourbon</span>, prince de Conti (1606-1727),
eldest son of the preceding, was treated with great liberality
by Louis XIV., and also by the regent, Philip duke of Orleans.
He served under Marshal Villars in the War of the Spanish
Succession, but he lacked the soldierly qualities of his father.
In 1713 he married Louise Elisabeth (1693-1775), daughter of
Louis Henri de Bourbon, prince de Condé, and grand-daughter
of Louis XIV. He was a prominent supporter of the financial
schemes of John Law, by which he made large sums of money.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Louis François de Bourbon</span>, prince de Conti (1717-1776),
only son of the preceding, adopted a military career, and when
the war of the Austrian Succession broke out in 1741 accompanied
Charles Louis, duc de Belle-Isle, to Bohemia. His services
there led to his appointment to command the army in Italy,
where he distinguished himself by forcing the pass of Villafranca
and winning the battle of Coni in 1744. In 1745 he was sent to
check the Imperialists in Germany, and in 1746 was transferred
to the Netherlands, where some jealousy between Marshal Saxe
and himself led to his retirement in 1747. In this year a faction
among the Polish nobles offered Conti the crown of that country,
where owing to the feeble health of King Augustus III. a vacancy
was expected. He won the personal support of Louis XV. for
his candidature, although the policy of the French ministers
was to establish the house of Saxony in Poland, as the dauphiness
was a daughter of Augustus. Louis therefore began secret
personal relations with his ambassadors in eastern Europe, who
were thus receiving contradictory instructions; a policy known
later as the <i>secret du roi</i>. Although Conti did not secure the Polish
throne he remained in the confidence of Louis until 1755, when
his influence was destroyed by the intrigues of Madame de
Pompadour; so that when the Seven Years&rsquo; War broke out in
1756 he was refused the command of the army of the Rhine,
and began the opposition to the administration which caused
Louis to refer to him as &ldquo;my cousin the advocate.&rdquo; In 1771
he was prominent in opposition to the chancellor Maupeou.
He supported the parlements against the ministry, was especially
active in his hostility to Turgot, and was suspected of aiding a
rising which took place at Dijon in 1775. Conti, who died on
the 2nd of August 1776, inherited literary tastes from his father,
was a brave and skilful general, and a diligent student of military
history. His house, over which the comtesse de Boufflers
presided, was the resort of many men of letters, and he was a
patron of Jean Jacques Rousseau.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Louis François Joseph</span>, prince de Conti (1734-1814), son
of the preceding, possessed considerable talent as a soldier, and
distinguished himself during the Seven Years&rsquo; War. He took
the side of Maupeou in the struggle between the chancellor and
the parlements, and in 1788 declared that the integrity of the
constitution must be maintained. He emigrated owing to the
weakness of Louis XVI., but refused to share in the plans for
the invasion of France, and returned to his native country in
1790. Arrested by order of the National Convention in 1793,
he was acquitted, but was reduced to poverty by the confiscation
of his possessions. He afterwards received a pension, but the
Directory banished him from France, and as he refused to share
in the plots of the royalists he lived at Barcelona till his death
in 1814, when the house of Conti became extinct.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTI, NICOLO DE&rsquo;</span> (fl. 1419-1444), Venetian explorer and
writer, was a merchant of noble family, who left Venice about
1419, on what proved an absence of 25 years. We next find
him in Damascus, whence he made his way over the north
Arabian desert, the Euphrates, and southern Mesopotamia,
to Bagdad. Here he took ship and sailed down the Tigris to
Basra and the head of the Persian Gulf; he next descended
the gulf to Ormuz, coasted along the Indian Ocean shore of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>29</span>
Persia (at one port of which he remained some time, and entered
into a business partnership with some Persian merchants), and
so reached the gulf and city of Cambay, where he began his
Indian life and observations. He next dropped down the west
coast of India to Ely, and struck inland to Vijayanagar, the
capital of the principal Hindu state of the Deccan, destroyed
in 1555. Of this city Conti gives an elaborate description, one
of the most interesting portions of his narrative. From Vijayanagar
and the Tungabudhra he travelled to Maliapur near
Madras, the traditional resting-place of the body of St Thomas,
and the holiest shrine of the native Nestorian Christians, then
&ldquo;scattered over all India,&rdquo; the Venetian declares, &ldquo;as the Jews
are among us.&rdquo; The narrative next refers to Ceylon, and gives
a very accurate account of the Cingalese cinnamon tree; but,
if Conti visited the island at all, it was probably on the return
journey. His outward route now took him to Sumatra, where
he stayed a year, and of whose cruel, brutal, cannibal natives
he gained a pretty full knowledge, as of the camphor, pepper
and gold of this &ldquo;Taprobana.&rdquo; From Sumatra a stormy
voyage of sixteen days brought him to Tenasserim, near the
head of the Malay Peninsula. We then find him at the mouth
of the Ganges, and trace him ascending and descending that
river (a journey of several months), visiting Burdwan and
Aracan, penetrating into Burma, and navigating the Irawadi to
Ava. He appears to have spent some time in Pegu, from which
he again plunged into the Malay Archipelago, and visited Java,
his farthest point. Here he remained nine months, and then
began his return by way of <i>Ciampa</i> (usually Cochin-China in
later medieval European literature, but here perhaps some more
westerly portion of Indo-China); a month&rsquo;s voyage from
Ciampa brought him to <i>Coloen</i>, doubtless Kulam or Quilon, in
the extreme south-west of India. Thence he continued his
homeward route, touching at Cochin, Calicut and Cambay, to
Sokotra, which he describes as still mainly inhabited by Nestorian
Christians; to the &ldquo;rich city&rdquo; of Aden, &ldquo;remarkable for its
buildings&rdquo;; to <i>Gidda</i> or Jidda, the port of Mecca; over the
desert to <i>Carras</i> or Cairo; and so to Venice, where he arrived
in 1444.</p>

<p>As a penance for his (compulsory) renunciation of the Christian
faith during his wanderings, Eugenius IV. ordered him to relate
his history to Poggio Bracciolini, the papal secretary. The
narrative closes with Conti&rsquo;s elaborate replies to Poggio&rsquo;s question
on Indian life, social classes, religion, fashions, manners, customs
and peculiarities of various kinds. Following a prevalent
fashion, the Venetian divides his Indies into three parts, the first
extending from Persia to the Indus; the second from the Indus
to the Ganges; the third including all beyond the Ganges;
this last he considered to excel the others in wealth, culture
and magnificence, and to be abreast of Italy in civilization.
We may note, moreover, Conti&rsquo;s account of the bamboo in the
Ganges valley; of the catching, taming and rearing of elephants
in Burma and other regions; of Indian tattooing and the use
of leaves for writing; of various Indian fruits, especially the
jack and mango; of the polyandry of Malabar; of the cockfighting
of Java; of what is apparently the bird of Paradise;
of Indian funeral ceremonies, and especially <i>suttee</i>; of the self-mutilation
and immolation of Indian fanatics; and of Indian
magic, navigation (&ldquo;they are not acquainted with the compass&rdquo;),
justice, &amp;c. Several venerable legends are reproduced; and
Conti&rsquo;s name-forms, partly through Poggio&rsquo;s vicious classicism,
are often absolutely unrecognizable; but on the whole this is
the best account of southern Asia by any European of the
15th century; while the traveller&rsquo;s visit to Sokotra is an almost
though not quite unique performance for a Latin Christian of

<p><span class="bold">CONTINENT</span> (from Lat. <i>continere</i>, &ldquo;to hold together&rdquo;;
hence &ldquo;connected,&rdquo; &ldquo;continuous&rdquo;), a word used in physical
geography of the larger continuous masses of land in contrast to
the great oceans, and as distinct from the submerged tracts
where only the higher parts appear above the sea, and from
islands generally.</p>

<p>On looking at a map of the world, continents appear generally
as wedge-shaped tracts pointing southward, while the oceans
have a polygonal shape. Eurasia is in some sense an exception,
but all the southern terminations of the continents advance
into the sea in the form of a wedge&mdash;South America, South
Africa, Arabia, India, Malaysia and Australia connected by a
submarine platform with Tasmania. It is difficult not to
believe that these remarkable characters have some relation
to the structure of the great globe-mass, and according to T. C.
Chamberlin and R. D. Salisbury, in their <i>Geology</i> (1906), &ldquo;the
true conception is perhaps that the ocean basins and continental
platforms are but the surface forms of great segments of the
lithosphere, all of which crowd towards the centre, the stronger
and heavier&mdash;the ocean basins&mdash;taking precedence and squeezing
the weaker and lighter ones&mdash;the continents&mdash;between them.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The area of the most depressed, or master segments, is almost
exactly twice that of the protruding or squeezed ones. This
estimate includes in the latter about 10,000,000 sq. m. now
covered with shallow water. The volume of the hydrosphere
is a little too great for the true basins, and it runs over, covering
the borders of the continents&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Continental Shelf</a></span>). Several
theories have been advanced to account for the roughly triangular
shape of the continents, but that presenting the least difficulty
is the one expressed above, &ldquo;since in a spherical surface divided
into larger and smaller segments the major part should be
polygonal, while the minor residual segments are more likely
to be triangular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As bearing on this geological idea, it is interesting to notice
in this connexion that the areas of volcanic activity are mostly
where continent and ocean meet; and that around the continents
there is an almost continuous &ldquo;deep&rdquo; from 100 to 300 m.
broad, of which the Challenger Deep (11,400 ft.) and the great
Tuscarora Deep are fragments. If on a map of the world a
broad inked brush be swept seawards round Africa, passing
into the Mediterranean, round North and South America,
round India, then continuously south of Java and round Australia
south of Tasmania and northward to the tropic, this broad band
will represent the encircling ribbon-like &ldquo;deep,&rdquo; which gives
strength to the suggestion that the continents in their main
features are permanent forms and that their structural connexion
with the oceans is not temporary and accidental. The great
protruding or &ldquo;squeezed&rdquo; segments are the Eurasian (with
an area roughly of twenty-four, reckoning in millions of square
miles), strongly ridged on the south and east, and relatively
flat on the north-west; the African (twelve), rather strongly
ridged on the east, less abruptly on the west and north; the
North American (ten), strongly ridged on the west, more gently
on the east, and relatively flat on the north and in the interior; the
South American (nine), strongly ridged on the west and somewhat
on the north-east and south-east, leaving ten for the smaller
blocks. The sum of these will represent one-third of the earth&rsquo;s
surface, while the remaining two-thirds is covered by the ocean.
The foundation structure of the continents is everywhere
similar. Their resulting rocks and soils are due to differential
minor movements in the past, by which deposits of varying
character were produced. These movements, taking place
periodically and followed by long periods of rest, produce
continued stability for the development and migration of forms
of life, the grading of rivers, the development of varied characteristic
land forms, the migration and settlement of human
beings, the facility or difficulty of intelligent intercourse between
races and communities, with finally the commercial interchange
of those commodities produced by varying climatic conditions
upon different parts of the continental surface; in short, for
those geographical factors which form the chief product of past
and present human history. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Geography</a></span>.)</p>

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CONTINENTAL SHELF,</span> the term in physical geography for
the submerged platform upon which a continent or island stands
in relief. If a coin or medal be partly sunk under water the
image and superscription will stand above water and represent
a continent with adjacent islands; the sunken part just submerged
will represent the continental shelf and the edge of the
coin the boundary between it and the surrounding deep, called
by Professor H. K. H. Wagner the continental slope. If the
lithosphere surface be divided into three parts, namely, the
continent heights, the ocean depths, and the transitional area
separating them, it will be found that this transitional area is
almost bisected by the coast-line, that nearly one-half of it
(10,000,000 sq. m.) lies under water less than 100 fathoms deep,
and the remainder 12,000,000 sq. m. is under 600 ft. in elevation.
There are thus two continuous plain systems, one above water and
one under water, and the second of these is called the continental
shelf. It represents the area which would be added to the land
surface if the sea fell 600 ft. This shelf varies in width. Round
Africa&mdash;except to the south&mdash;and off the western coasts of
America it scarcely exists. It is wide under the British Islands
and extends as a continuous platform under the North Sea,
down the English Channel to the south of France; it unites
Australia to New Guinea on the north and to Tasmania on the
south, connects the Malay Archipelago along the broad shelf east
of China with Japan, unites north-western America with Asia,
sweeps in a symmetrical curve outwards from north-eastern
America towards Greenland, curving downwards outside Newfoundland
and holding Hudson Bay in the centre of a shallow
dish. In many places it represents the land planed down by
wave action to a plain of marine denudation, where the waves
have battered down the cliffs and dragged the material under
water. If there were no compensating action in the differential
movement of land and sea in the transitional area, the whole
of the land would be gradually planed down to a submarine
platform, and all the globe would be covered with water. There
are, however, periodical warpings of this transitional area by
which fresh areas of land are raised above sea-level, and fresh
continental coast-lines produced, while the sea tends to sink
more deeply into the great ocean basins, so that the continents
slowly increase in size. &ldquo;In many cases it is possible that the
continental shelf is the end of a low plain submerged by
subsidence; in others a low plain may be an upheaved continental
shelf, and probably wave action is only one of the factors
at work&rdquo; (H. R. Mill, <i>Realm of Nature</i>, 1897).</p>

<p>1. The simple continued fraction is both the most interesting
and important kind of continued fraction.</p>

<p>Any quantity, commensurable or incommensurable, can be
expressed uniquely as a simple continued fraction, terminating in
the case of a commensurable quantity, non-terminating in the case
of an incommensurable quantity. A non-terminating simple continued

<p>The numerators and denominators of the successive convergents

that every convergent is in its lowest terms. The other principal
properties of the convergents are:&mdash;</p>

<p>The odd convergents form an increasing series of rational fractions
continually approaching to the value of the whole continued fraction;
the even convergents form a decreasing series having the same
property.</p>

<p>Every even convergent is greater than every odd convergent;
every odd convergent is less than, and every even convergent
greater than, any following convergent.</p>

<p>Every convergent is nearer to the value of the whole fraction

<p>Every convergent is a nearer approximation to the value of the

D, which shall most closely approximate (by excess or defect, as
may be assigned) to a given number commensurable or incommensurable,&rdquo;
the reader is referred to G. Chrystal&rsquo;s <i>Algebra</i>, where also
may be found details of the application of continued fractions to
such interesting and important problems as the recurrence of eclipses
and the rectification of the <a href="#artlinks">calendar</a> (q.v.).</p>

<p>Lagrange used simple continued fractions to approximate to the
solutions of numerical equations; thus, if an equation has a root
between two integers a and a + 1, put x = a + 1/y and form the
equation in y; if the equation in y has a root between b and b + 1,
put y = b + 1/z, and so on. Such a method is, however, too tedious,
compared with such a method as Homer&rsquo;s, to be of any practical
value.</p>

<p>The solution in integers of the indeterminate equation ax + by = c
may be effected by means of continued fractions. If we suppose a/b
to be converted into a continued fraction and p/q to be the penultimate
convergent, we have aq - bp = +1 or -1, according as
the number of convergents is even or odd, which we can take them
to be as we please. If we take aq-bp = +1 we have a general
solution in integers of ax + by = c, viz. x = cq - bt, y = at - cp; if we
take aq - bp = -1, we have x = bt - cq, y = cp - at.</p>

<p>An interesting application of continued fractions to establish a
unique correspondence between the elements of an aggregate of m
dimensions and an aggregate of n dimensions is given by G. Cantor
in vol. 2 of the <i>Acta Mathematica</i>.</p>

<p>Applications of simple continued fractions to the theory of
numbers, as, for example, to prove the theorem that a divisor of the
sum of two squares is itself the sum of two squares, may be found
in J. A. Serret&rsquo;s <i>Cours d&rsquo;Algèbre Supérieure</i>.</p>

<p>The second case illustrates a feature of the recurring continued
fraction which represents a complete quadratic surd. There is only
one non-recurring partial quotient a<sub>1</sub>. If b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, ..., b<sub>n</sub> is the cycle
of recurring quotients, then b<sub>n</sub> = 2a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub> = b<sub>n-1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub> = b<sub>n-2</sub>, b<sub>3</sub> = b<sub>n-3</sub>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the case of a recurring continued fraction which represents
&radic;N, where N is an integer, if n is the number of partial quotients in
the recurring cycle, and p<sub>nr</sub>/q<sub>nr</sub> the nr<sup>th</sup> convergent, then p<sup>2</sup><sub>nr</sub> -Nq<sup>2</sup><sub>nr</sub>
= (-1)<sup>nr</sup>, whence, if n is odd, integral solutions of the indeterminate
equation x² - Ny² = &plusmn;1 (the so-called Pellian equation) can be found.
If n is even, solutions of the equation x² -Ny² = +1 can be found.</p>

<p>The theory and development of the simple recurring continued
fraction is due to Lagrange. For proofs of the theorems here stated
and for applications to the more general indeterminate equation
x² -Ny² = H the reader may consult Chrystal&rsquo;s <i>Algebra</i> or Serret&rsquo;s

<p>2. <i>The Convergence of Infinite Continued Fractions.</i>&mdash;We have seen
that the simple infinite continued fraction converges. The infinite
general continued fraction of the first class cannot diverge for its
value lies between that of its first two convergents. It may, however,
oscillate. We have the relation p<sub>n</sub>q<sub>n-1</sub> - p<sub>n-1</sub>q<sub>n</sub> = (-1)<sup>n</sup>b<sub>2</sub>b<sub>3</sub>...b<sub>n</sub>,
from which</p>

<p>The tests for convergency are as follows:</p>

<p>For the convergence of the continued fraction of the second class
there is no complete criterion. The following theorem covers a large

<p class="center"><i>Historical Note.</i></p>

<p>The invention of continued fractions is ascribed generally to
Pietro Antonia Cataldi, an Italian mathematician who died in
1626. He used them to represent square roots, but only for
particular numerical examples, and appears to have had no
theory on the subject. A previous writer, Rafaello Bombelli,
had used them in his treatise on Algebra (about 1579), and it is
quite possible that Cataldi may have got his ideas from him.
His chief advance on Bombelli was in his notation. They next
appear to have been used by Daniel Schwenter (1585-1636)
in a <i>Geometrica Practica</i> published in 1618. He uses them for
approximations. The theory, however, starts with the publication
in 1655 by Lord Brouncker of the continued fraction</p>

<p>John Wallis, discussing this fraction in his <i>Arithmetica Infinitorum</i>
(1656), gives many of the elementary properties of the
convergents to the general continued fraction, including the rule
for their formation. Huygens (<i>Descriptio automati planetarii</i>,
1703) uses the simple continued fraction for the purpose of
approximation when designing the toothed wheels of his <i>Planetarium</i>.
Nicol Saunderson (1682-1739), Euler and Lambert
helped in developing the theory, and much was done by Lagrange
in his additions to the French edition of Euler&rsquo;s <i>Algebra</i> (1795).
Moritz A. Stern wrote at length on the subject in <i>Crelle&rsquo;s Journal</i>
(x., 1833; xi., 1834; xviii., 1838). The theory of the convergence
of continued fractions is due to Oscar Schlömilch,
P. F. Arndt, P. L. Seidel and Stern. O. Stolz, A. Pringsheim
and E. B. van Vleck have written on the convergence of infinite
continued fractions with complex elements.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTOUR, CONTOUR-LINE</span> (a French word meaning generally
&ldquo;outline,&rdquo; from the Med. Lat. <i>contornare</i>, to round off), in physical
geography a line drawn upon a map through all the points upon
the surface represented that are of equal height above sea-level.
These points lie, therefore, upon a horizontal plane at a given
elevation passing through the land shown on the map, and the
contour-line is the intersection of that horizontal plane with
the surface of the ground. The contour-line of 0, or <i>datum level</i>,
is the coastal boundary of any land form. If the sea be imagined
as rising 100 ft., a new coast-line, with bays and estuaries indented
in the valleys, would appear at the new sea-level. If the sea
sank once more to its former level, the 100-ft. contour-line with
all its irregularities would be represented by the beach mark
made by the sea when 100 ft. higher. If instead of receding the
sea rose continuously at the rate of 100 ft. per day, a series of
levels 100 ft. above one another would be marked daily upon the
land until at last the highest mountain peaks appeared as islands
less than 100 ft. high. A record of this series of advances
marked upon a flat map of the original country would give a
series of concentric contour-lines narrowing towards the mountain-tops,
which they would at last completely surround. Contour-lines
of this character are marked upon most modern maps
of small areas and upon all government survey and military maps
at varying intervals according to the scale of the map.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTRABAND</span> (Fr. <i>contrebande</i>, from <i>contra</i>, against, and
<i>bannum</i>, Low Lat. for &ldquo;proclamation&rdquo;), a term given generally
to illegal traffic; and particularly, as &ldquo;contraband of war,&rdquo;
to goods, &amp;c., which subjects of neutral states are forbidden by
international law to supply to a belligerent.</p>

<p>According to current practice contraband of war is of two
kinds: (1) absolute or unconditional contraband, i.e. materials
of direct application in naval or military armaments; and
(2) conditional contraband, consisting of articles which are fit for,
but not necessarily of direct application to, hostile uses. There is
much difference of opinion among international jurists and states,
however, as to the specific materials and articles which may
rightfully be declared by belligerents to belong to either class.
There is also disagreement as to the belligerent right where
the immediate destination is a neutral but the ultimate an enemy
port.</p>

<p>An attempt was made at the Second Hague Conference to
come to an agreement on the chief points of difference. The
British delegates were instructed even to abandon the principle
of contraband of war altogether, subject only to the exclusion
by blockade of neutral trade from enemy ports. In the alternative
they were to do their utmost to restrict the definition of
contraband within the narrowest possible limits, and to obtain
exemption of food-stuffs destined for places other than beleaguered
fortresses and of raw materials required for peaceful
industry. Though the discussions at the conference did not
result in any convention, except on the subject of mails, it was
agreed among the leading maritime states that an early attempt
should be made to codify the law of naval war generally, in
connexion with the establishment of an international prize
court (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prize</a></span>).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the subject of mails, important articles were
adopted which figure in the &ldquo;Convention on restrictions
<span class="sidenote">Mails.</span>
in the right of capture&rdquo; (No. 11 of the series
as set out in the General Act, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peace Conference</a></span>). They
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condenced">
<p><span class="sc">Art. I.</span>&mdash;The postal correspondence of neutrals or belligerents,
whatever its official or private character may be, found on the high
seas on board a neutral or enemy ship is inviolable. If the ship is
detained, the correspondence is forwarded by the captor with the
least possible delay.</p>

<p>The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply, in case
of violation of blockade, to correspondence destined for, or proceeding
from, a blockaded port.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. II.</span>&mdash;The inviolability of postal correspondence does not exempt
a neutral mail ship from the laws and customs of maritime war as
to neutral merchant ships in general. The ship, however, may
not be searched except when absolutely necessary, and then only
with as much consideration and expedition as possible.</p>
</div>

<p>As regards food-stuffs Great Britain has long and consistently
held that provisions and liquors fit for the consumption of the
enemy&rsquo;s naval or military forces are contraband.
<span class="sidenote">Foodstuffs and pre-emption.</span>
Her Prize Act, however, provides a palliative, in the
case of &ldquo;naval or victualling stores,&rdquo; for the penalty
attaching to absolute contraband, the lords of the
admiralty being entitled to exercise a right of pre-emption over
such stores, i.e. to purchase them without condemnation in a
prize court. In practice, purchases are made at the market
value of the goods, with an additional 10% for loss of profit.</p>

<p>On the continent of Europe no such palliative has yet been
adopted; but moved by the same desire to distinguish unmistakable
from, so to speak, constructive contraband, and to protect
trade against the vexation of uncertainty, many continental
jurists have come to argue conditional contraband away altogether.
This change of opinion has especially manifested
itself in the discussions on the subject in the Institute of International
Law, a body composed exclusively of recognized
international jurists. The rules this body adopted in 1896,
though they do not represent the unanimous feeling of its
members, may be taken as the view of a large proportion of
them. The majority comprised German, Danish, Italian,
Dutch and French specialists. The rules adopted contain a
clause, which, after declaring conditional contraband abolished,
states that: &ldquo;Nevertheless the belligerent has, at his option
and on condition of paying an equitable indemnity, a right of
sequestration or pre-emption as to articles (<i>objets</i>) which, on
their way to a port of the enemy, may serve equally in war or
in peace.&rdquo; This rule, it is seen, is of wider application than the
above-mentioned provision of the British Prize Act. To become
binding in its existing form, either an alteration of the text of
the Declaration of Paris or a modification in the wording of
the clause would be necessary, seeing that under the Declaration
of Paris &ldquo;the neutral flag covers enemy goods, except contraband
of war.&rdquo; It may be said that, in so far as the continent is
concerned, expert opinion is, on the whole, favourable to the
recognition of conditional contraband in the form of a right of
sequestration or pre-emption and within the limits Great Britain
has shown a disposition to set to it as against herself.</p>

<p>As regards coal there is no essential difference between the
position of coal to feed ships and that of provisions to feed men.
Neither is <i>per se</i> contraband. At the West African
<span class="sidenote">Coal.</span>
Conference in 1884 the Russian representative protested
against its inclusion among contraband articles, but the
Russian government included it in their declaration as to contraband
on the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War. In 1898
the British foreign office replied to an inquiry of the Newport
Chamber of Commerce on the position of coal that: &ldquo;Whether
in any particular case coal is or is not contraband of war, is a
matter prima facie for the determination of the Prize Court
of the captor&rsquo;s nationality, and so long as such decision, when
given, does not conflict with well-established principles of international
law, H.M.&rsquo;s government will not be prepared to take
exception thereto.&rdquo; The practical applications of the law and
usage of contraband in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5,
however, brought out vividly the need of reform in these &ldquo;well-established
principles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Japanese regulations gave rise to no serious difficulties.
Those issued by Russia, on the other hand, led to
much controversy between the British government
<span class="sidenote">Controversy with  Russia in Russo-Japanese War.</span>
and that of Russia, in connexion with the latter&rsquo;s
pretension to class coal, rice, provisions, forage, horses
and cotton with arms, ammunition, explosives, &amp;c., as
absolute contraband. On June 1, 1904, Lord Lansdowne
expressed the surprise with which the British government learnt
that rice and provisions were to be treated as unconditionally
contraband&mdash;&ldquo;a step which they regarded as inconsistent with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>34</span>
the law and practice of nations.&rdquo; They furthermore &ldquo;felt
themselves bound to reserve their rights by also protesting
against the doctrine that it is for the belligerent to decide what
articles are as a matter of course, and without reference to other
considerations, to be dealt with as contraband of war, regardless
of the well-established rights of neutrals&rdquo;; nor would the
British government consider itself bound to recognize as valid
the decision of any prize court which violated those rights.
It did not dispute the right of a belligerent to take adequate
precautions for the purpose of preventing contraband of war,
in the hitherto accepted sense of the words, from reaching the
enemy; but it objected to the introduction of a new doctrine
under which &ldquo;the well-understood distinction between conditional
and unconditional contraband was altogether ignored, and under
which, moreover, on the discovery of articles alleged to be
contraband, the ship carrying them was, without trial and in
spite of her neutrality, subjected to penalties which are reluctantly
enforced even against an enemy&rsquo;s ship.&rdquo; (See section
40 of Russian Instructions on Procedure in Stopping, Examining
and Seizing Merchant Vessels, published in <i>London Gazette</i> of
March 18, 1904.) In particular circumstances provisions might
acquire a contraband character, as, for instance, if they should
be consigned direct to the army or fleet of a belligerent, or to a
port where such fleet might be lying, and if facts should exist
raising the presumption that they were about to be employed
in victualling the fleet of the enemy. In such cases it was not
denied that the other belligerent would be entitled to seize the
provisions as contraband of war, on the ground that they would
afford material assistance towards the carrying on of warlike
operations. But it could not be admitted that if such
provisions were consigned to the port of a belligerent (even
though it should be a port of naval equipment) they should
therefore be necessarily regarded as contraband of war. The
test was whether there were circumstances relating to any
particular cargo to show that it was destined for military or
naval use.</p>

<p>The Russian government replied that they could not admit
that articles of dual use when addressed to private individuals
in the enemy&rsquo;s country should be necessarily free from seizure
and condemnation, since provisions and such articles of dual
use, though intended for the military or naval forces of the
enemy, would obviously, under such circumstances, be addressed
to private individuals, possibly agents or contractors for the
naval or military authorities.</p>

<p>Lord Lansdowne in answer stated that while H.M. government
did not contend that the mere fact that the consignee was a
private person should necessarily give immunity from capture,
they held that to take vessels for adjudication merely because
their destination was the enemy&rsquo;s country would be vexatious,
and constitute an unwarrantable interference with neutral
commerce. To render a vessel liable to such treatment there
should be circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion
that the provisions were destined for the enemy&rsquo;s forces, and
it was in such a case for the captor &ldquo;to establish the fact of
destination for the enemy&rsquo;s forces before attempting to procure
their condemnation&rdquo; (September 30, 1904).</p>

<p>The protests of Great Britain led to the reference of the subject
by the Russian government to a departmental committee, with
the result that on October 22, 1904, a rectifying notice was issued
declaring that articles capable of serving for a warlike object, including
rice and food-stuffs, should be considered as contraband
of war, if they are destined for the government of the belligerent
power or its administration or its army or its navy or its fortresses
or its naval ports; or for the purveyors thereof; and that in
cases where they were addressed to private individuals these
articles should not be considered as contraband of war; but that
in all cases horses and beasts of burden were to be considered
as contraband. As regards cotton, explanations were given by
the Russian government (May 11, 1904) that the prohibition
of cotton applied only to raw cotton suitable for the manufacture
of explosives, and not to yarn or tissues.</p>

<p>The carriage of belligerent despatches connected with the conduct
of a war or of persons in the service of a belligerent state
falls within the prohibition of contraband traffic,
<span class="sidenote">Analogues of contraband.</span>
but to distinguish such traffic from that of contraband,
properly so called, the term applied to it in international
law is &ldquo;analogues of contraband.&rdquo; The penalty
attaching to such carriage necessarily varies according to the
degree of the analogy.</p>

<p>Trade between neutrals has a prima facie right to go on, in
spite of war, without molestation. But if the ultimate destination
of goods, though shipped first to a neutral port,
<span class="sidenote">Continuous voyages.</span>
is enemy&rsquo;s territory, then, according to the doctrine
of &ldquo;continuous voyages,&rdquo; the goods may be treated
as if they had been shipped to the enemy&rsquo;s territory direct.
The doctrine is entirely Anglo-Saxon in its origin<a name="FnAnchor_1d" href="#Footnote_1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and development.
Only in one case does it seem ever to have been actually
put in force by a foreign prize court, namely, in the case of the
&ldquo;Doelwijk,&rdquo; a Dutch vessel which was adjudged good prize
by an Italian court on the ground that, although bound for
Djibouti, a French port, it was laden with a provision of arms
of a model which had gone out of use in Europe, and could only be
destined for the Abyssinians, with whom Italy was at war.</p>

<p>The Institute of International Law in 1896 adopted the
following rule on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condenced">
<p>&ldquo;Destination to the enemy is presumed, where the shipment
is to one of the enemy ports, or to a neutral port, if it is unquestionably
proved by the facts that the neutral port was only a state
(<i>étape</i>) towards the enemy as the final destination of a single commercial
operation.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>During the South African War (1899-1902) Great Britain was
involved in controversy with Germany, who at first declined
to recognize the existence of any rule which could interfere
with trade between neutrals, the German vessels in question
having been stopped on their way to a neutral port.</p>

<p>As stated above, the Second Hague Conference failed to come
to any understanding on contraband, but the subject was exhaustively
dealt with by the Conference of London (1908-1909) on
the laws and customs of naval war, in the following articles:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condenced">
<p><span class="sc">Art. 22.</span>&mdash;The following articles may, without notice, be treated
as contraband of war, under the name of absolute contraband: (1)
Arms of all kinds, including arms for sporting purposes, and their
distinctive component parts; (2) projectiles, charges and cartridges
of all kinds, and their distinctive component parts; (3) powder and
explosives specially prepared for use in war; (4) gun-mountings,
limber boxes, limbers, military wagons, field forges and their distinctive
component parts; (5) clothing and equipment of a distinctively
military character; (6) all kinds of harness of a distinctively
military character; (7) saddle, draught and pack animals suitable
for use in war; (8) articles of camp equipment and their distinctive
component parts; (9) armour plates; (10) warships, including boats,
and their distinctive component parts of such a nature that they
can only be used on a vessel of war; (11) implements and apparatus
designed exclusively for the manufacture of munitions of war, for the
manufacture or repair of arms, or war material for use on land or sea.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 23.</span>&mdash;Articles exclusively used for war may be added to the
list of absolute contraband by a declaration, which must be notified.
Such notification must be addressed to the governments of other
powers, or to their representatives accredited to the power making
the declaration. A notification made after the outbreak of hostilities
is addressed only to neutral powers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 24.</span>&mdash;The following articles, susceptible of use in war as well
as for purposes of peace, may, without notice, be treated as contraband
of war, under the name of conditional contraband: (1) Foodstuffs;
(2) forage and grain, suitable for feeding animals; (3)
clothing, fabrics for clothing, and boots and shoes, suitable for use
in war; (4) gold and silver in coin or bullion; paper money; (5)
vehicles of all kinds available for use in war, and their component
parts; (6) vessels, craft and boats of all kinds; floating docks, parts
of docks and their component parts; (7) railway material, both fixed
and rolling-stock, and material for telegraphs, wireless telegraphs
and telephones; (8) balloons and flying machines and their distinctive
component parts, together with accessories and articles
recognizable as intended for use in connexion with balloons and
flying machines; (9) fuel; lubricants; (10) powder and explosives
not specially prepared for use in war; (11) barbed wire and implements
for fixing and cutting the same; (12) horseshoes and shoeing
materials; (13) harness and saddlery; (14) field glasses, telescopes,
chronometers and all kinds of nautical instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>35</span></p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 25.</span>&mdash;Articles susceptible of use in war as well as for purposes
of peace, other than those enumerated in Articles 22 and 24, may be
added to the list of conditional contraband by a declaration, which
must be notified in the manner provided for in the second paragraph
of Article 23.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 26.</span>&mdash;If a power waives, so far as it is concerned, the right to
treat as contraband of war an article comprised in any of the classes
enumerated in Articles 22 and 24, such intention shall be announced
by a declaration, which must be notified in the manner provided for
in the second paragraph of Article 23.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 27.</span>&mdash;Articles which are not susceptible of use in war may not
be declared contraband of war.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 28.</span>&mdash;The following may not be declared contraband of war:
(1) Raw cotton, wool, silk, jute, flax, hemp and other raw materials of
the textile industries, and yarns of the same; (2) oil seeds and nuts;
copra; (3) rubber, resins, gums and lacs; hops; (4) raw hides
and horns, bones and ivory; (5) natural and artificial manures,
including nitrates and phosphates for agricultural purposes; (6)
metallic ores; (7) earths, clays, lime, chalk, stone, including marble,
bricks, slates and tiles; (8) Chinaware and glass; (9) paper and
paper-making materials; (10) soap, paint and colours, including
articles exclusively used in their manufacture, and varnish; (11)
bleaching powder, soda ash, caustic soda, salt cake, ammonia,
sulphate of ammonia and sulphate of copper; (12) agricultural,
mining, textile and printing machinery; (13) precious and semiprecious
stones, pearls, mother-of-pearl and coral; (14) clocks and
watches, other than chronometers; (15) fashion and fancy goods;
(16) feathers of all kinds, hairs and bristles; (17) articles of household
furniture and decoration; office furniture and requisites.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 29.</span>&mdash;Likewise the following may not be treated as contraband
of war: (1) Articles serving exclusively to aid the sick and wounded.
They can, however, in case of urgent military necessity and subject
to the payment of compensation, be requisitioned, if their destination
is that specified in Article 30; (2) articles intended for the use of the
vessel in which they are found, as well as those intended for the use
of her crew and passengers during the voyage.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 30.</span>&mdash;Absolute contraband is liable to capture if it is shown
to be destined to territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy,
or to the armed forces of the enemy. It is immaterial whether the
carriage of the goods is direct or entails transhipment or a subsequent
transport by land.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 31.</span>&mdash;Proof of the destination specified in Article 30 is complete
in the following cases: (1) When the goods are documented
for discharge in an enemy port, or for delivery to the armed forces
of the enemy; (2) when the vessel is to call at enemy ports only, or
when she is to touch at an enemy port or meet the armed forces of
the enemy before reaching the neutral port for which the goods in
question are documented.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 32.</span>&mdash;Where a vessel is carrying absolute contraband, her
papers are conclusive proof as to the voyage on which she is engaged,
unless she is found clearly out of the course indicated by her papers
and unable to give adequate reasons to justify such deviation.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 33.</span>&mdash;Conditional contraband is liable to capture if it is shown
to be destined for the use of the armed forces or of a government
department of the enemy state, unless in this latter case the circumstances
show that the goods cannot in fact be used for the purposes
of the war in progress. This latter exception does not apply to a
consignment coming under Article 24 (4).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 34.</span>&mdash;The destination referred to in Article 33 is presumed to
exist if the goods are consigned to enemy authorities, or to a contractor
established in the enemy country who, as a matter of common
knowledge, supplies articles of this kind to the enemy. A similar
presumption arises if the goods are consigned to a fortified place
belonging to the enemy, or other place serving as a base for the armed
forces of the enemy. No such presumption, however, arises in the
case of a merchant vessel bound for one of these places if it is sought
to prove that she herself is contraband. In cases where the above
presumptions do not arise, the destination is presumed to be innocent.
The presumptions set up by this article may be rebutted.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 35.</span>&mdash;Conditional contraband is not liable to capture, except
when found on board a vessel bound for territory belonging to or
occupied by the enemy, or for the armed forces of the enemy, and
when it is not to be discharged in an intervening neutral port. The
ship&rsquo;s papers are conclusive proof both as to the voyage on which
the vessel is engaged and as to the port of discharge of the goods,
unless she is found clearly out of the course indicated by her papers,
and unable to give adequate reasons to justify such deviation.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 36.</span>&mdash;Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 35, conditional
contraband, if shown to have the destination referred to in
Article 33, is liable to capture in cases where the enemy country has
no seaboard.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 37.</span>&mdash;A vessel carrying goods liable to capture as absolute or
conditional contraband may be captured on the high seas or in the
territorial waters of the belligerents throughout the whole of her
voyage, even if she is to touch at a port of call before reaching the
hostile destination.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 38.</span>&mdash;A vessel may not be captured on the ground that she
has carried contraband on a previous occasion if such carriage is in
point of fact at an end.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 39.</span>&mdash;Contraband goods are liable to condemnation.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 40.</span>&mdash;A vessel carrying contraband may be condemned if the
contraband, reckoned either by value, weight, volume or freight,
forms more than half the cargo.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 41.</span>&mdash;If a vessel carrying contraband is released, she may be
condemned to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the captor
in respect of the proceedings in the national prize court and the
custody of the ship and cargo during the proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 42.</span>&mdash;Goods which belong to the owner of the contraband
and are on board the same vessel are liable to condemnation.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 43.</span>&mdash;If a vessel is encountered at sea while unaware of the
outbreak of hostilities or of the declaration of contraband which
applies to her cargo, the contraband cannot be condemned except
on payment of compensation; the vessel herself and the remainder
of the cargo are not liable to condemnation or to the costs and
expenses referred to in Article 41. The same rule applies if the
master, after becoming aware of the outbreak of hostilities, or of the
declaration of contraband, has had no opportunity of discharging
the contraband. A vessel is deemed to be aware of the existence of a
state of war, or of a declaration of contraband, if she left a neutral
port subsequently to the notification to the power to which such port
belongs of the outbreak of hostilities or of the declaration of contraband
respectively, provided that such notification was made in
sufficient time. A vessel is also deemed to be aware of the existence
of a state of war if she left an enemy port after the outbreak of
hostilities.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Art. 44.</span>&mdash;A vessel which has been stopped on the ground that she
is carrying contraband, and which is not liable to condemnation on
account of the proportion of contraband on board, may, when the
circumstances permit, be allowed to continue her voyage if the
master is willing to hand over the contraband to the belligerent
warship. The delivery of the contraband must be entered by the
captor on the log-book of the vessel stopped, and the master must
give the captor duly certified copies of all relevant papers. The
captor is at liberty to destroy the contraband that has been handed
over to him under these conditions.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTRACT</span> (Lat. <i>contractus</i>, from <i>contrahere</i>, to draw together,
to bind), the legal term for a bargain or agreement; some writers,
following the Indian Contract Act, confine the term to agreements
enforceable by law: this, though not yet universally
adopted, seems an improvement. Enforcement of good faith
in matters of bargain and promise is among the most important
functions of legal justice. It might not be too much to say
that, next after keeping the peace and securing property against
violence and fraud so that business may be possible, it is the most
important. Yet we shall find that the importance of contract is
developed comparatively late in the history of law. The commonwealth
needs elaborate rules about contracts only when it is
advanced enough in civilization and trade to have an elaborate
system of credit. The Roman law of the empire dealt with
contract, indeed, in a fairly adequate manner, though it never
had a complete or uniform theory; and the Roman law, as settled
by Justinian, appears to have satisfied the Eastern empire long
after the Western nations had begun to recast their institutions,
and the traders of the Mediterranean had struck out a cosmopolitan
body of rules and custom known as the Law Merchant,
which claimed acceptance in the name neither of Justinian nor
of the Church, but of universal reason. It was amply proved
afterwards that the foundations of the Roman system were strong
enough to carry the fabric of modern legislation. But the
collapse of the Roman power in western Christendom threw
society back into chaos, and reduced men&rsquo;s ideas of ordered
justice and law to a condition compared with which the earliest
Roman law known to us is modern.</p>

<p>In this condition of legal ideas, which it would be absurd to
call jurisprudence, the general duty of keeping faith is not
recognized except as a matter of religious or social observance.
Those who desire to be assured of anything that lies in promise
must exact an oath, or a pledge, or personal sureties; and even
then the court of their people&mdash;in England the Hundred Court in
the first instance&mdash;will do nothing for them in the first case,
and not much in the two latter. Probably the settlement
of a blood-feud, with provisions for the payment of the fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>36</span>
by instalments, was the nearest approach to a continuing contract,
as we now understand the term, which the experience of
Germanic antiquity could furnish. It is also probable that the
performance of such undertakings, as it concerned the general
peace, was at an early time regarded as material to the commonweal;
and that these covenants of peace, rather than the
rudimentary selling and bartering of their day, first caused our
Germanic ancestors to realize the importance of putting some
promises at any rate under public sanction. We have not now
to attempt any reconstruction of archaic judgment and justice,
or the lack of either, at any period of the darkness and twilight
which precede the history of the middle ages. But the history
of the law, and even the present form of much law still common
to almost all the English-speaking world, can be understood
only when we bear in mind that our forefathers did not start
from any general conception of the state&rsquo;s duty to enforce
private agreements, but, on the contrary, the state&rsquo;s powers and
functions in this regard were extended gradually, unsystematically,
and by shifts and devices of ingenious suitors and counsel,
aided by judges, rather than by any direct provisions of princes
and rulers. Money debts, it is true, were recoverable from an
early time. But this was not because the debtor had promised
to repay the loan; it was because the money was deemed still to
belong to the creditor, as if the identical coins were merely in
the debtor&rsquo;s custody. The creditor sued to recover money, for
centuries after the Norman Conquest, in exactly the same form
which he would have used to demand possession of land; the
action of debt closely resembled the &ldquo;real actions,&rdquo; and, like
them, might be finally determined by a judicial combat; and
down to Blackstone&rsquo;s time the creditor was said to have a
property in the debt&mdash;property which the debtor had &ldquo;granted&rdquo;
him. Giving credit, in this way of thinking, is not reliance on
the right to call hereafter for an act, the payment of so much
current money or its equivalent, to be performed by the debtor,
but merely suspension of the immediate right to possess one&rsquo;s
own particular money, as the owner of a house let for a term
suspends his right to occupy it. This was no road to the modern
doctrine of contract, and the passage had to be made another way.</p>

<p>In fact the old action of debt covered part of the ground of
contract only by accident. It was really an action to recover
any property that was not land; for the remedy of
<span class="sidenote">Action for debt.</span>
a dispossessed owner of chattels, afterwards known
as detinue, was only a slightly varying form of it.
If the property claimed was a certain sum of money, it might
be due because the defendant had received money on loan, or
because he had received goods of which the agreed price remained
unpaid; or, in later times at any rate, because he had become
liable in some way by judgment, statute or other authority of
law, to pay a fine or fixed penalty to the plaintiff. Here the
person recovering might be as considerable as the lord of a manor,
or as mean as a &ldquo;common informer&rdquo;; the principle was the
same. In every case outside this last class, that is to say, whenever
there was a debt in the popular sense of the word, it had to
be shown that the defendant had actually received the money
or goods; this value received came to be called <i>quid pro quo</i>&mdash;a
term unknown, to all appearance, out of England. Nevertheless
the foundation of the plaintiff&rsquo;s right was not bargain or
promise, but the unjust detention by the defendant of the
plaintiff&rsquo;s money or goods.</p>

<p>We are not concerned here to trace the change from the
ancient method of proof&mdash;oath backed by &ldquo;good suit,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
the oaths of an adequate number of friends and
<span class="sidenote">Modes of proof.</span>
neighbours&mdash;through the earlier form of jury trial, in
which the jury were supposed to know the truth of
their own knowledge, to the modern establishment of facts by
testimony brought before a jury who are bound to give their
verdict according to the evidence. But there was one mode of
proof which, after the Norman Conquest, made a material
addition to the substantive law. This was the proof by writing,
which means writing authenticated by seal. Proof by writing
was admitted under Roman influence, but, once admitted, it
acquired the character of being conclusive which belonged to all
proof in early Germanic procedure. Oath, ordeal and battle
were all final in their results. When the process was started
there was no room for discussion. So the sealed writing was
final too, and a man could not deny his own deed. We still say
that he cannot, but with modern refinements. Thus the deed,
being allowed as a solemn and probative document, furnished
a means by which a man could bind himself, or rather effectually
declare himself bound, to anything not positively forbidden by
law. Whoever could afford parchment and the services of a
clerk might have the benefit of a &ldquo;formal contract&rdquo; in the
Roman sense of the term. At this day the form of deed called
a bond or &ldquo;obligation&rdquo; is, as it stands settled after various
experiments, extremely artificial; but it is essentially a solemn
admission of liability, though its conclusive stringency has been
relaxed by modern legislation and practice in the interest of substantial
justice. By this means the performance of all sorts of
undertakings, pecuniary and otherwise, could be and was legally
secured. Bonds were well known in the 13th century, and from
the 14th century onwards were freely used for commercial
and other purposes; as for certain limited purposes they still
are. The &ldquo;covenant&rdquo; of modern draftsmen is a direct promise
made by deed; it occurs mainly as incident to conveyances of
land. The medieval &ldquo;covenant,&rdquo; <i>conventio</i>, was, when we first
hear of it, practically equivalent to a lease, and never became
a common instrument of miscellaneous contracting, though the
old books recognize the possibility of turning it to various uses
of which there are examples; nor had it any sensible influence
on the later development of the law. On the whole, in the old
common law one could do a great deal by deed, but very little
without deed. The minor bargains of daily life, so far as they
involved mutual credit, were left to the jurisdiction of inferior
courts, of the Law Merchant, and&mdash;last, not least&mdash;of the Church.</p>

<p>Popular custom, in all European countries, recognized simpler
ways of pledging faith than parchment and seal. A handshake
was enough to bind a bargain. Whatever secular law
<span class="sidenote">Fidel laesio.</span>
might say, the Church said it was an open sin to break
plighted faith; a matter, therefore, for spiritual
correction, in other words, for compulsion exercised on the
defaulter by the bishop&rsquo;s or the archdeacon&rsquo;s court, armed
with the power of excommunication. In this way the ecclesiastical
courts acquired much business which was, in fact, as secular
as that of a modern county court, with the incident profits.
Medieval courts lived by the suitors&rsquo; fees. What were the king&rsquo;s
judges to do? However high they put their claims in the
course of the rivalry between Church and Crown, they could not
effectually prohibit the bishop or his official from dealing with
matters for which the king&rsquo;s court provided no remedy. Continental
jurists had seen their way, starting from the Roman
system as it was left by Justinian, to reduce its formalities
to a vanishing quantity, and expand their jurisdiction to the
full breadth of current usage. English judges could not do this
in the 15th century, if they could ever have done so. Nor would
simplification of the requisites of a deed, such as has now been
introduced in many jurisdictions, have been of much use at a
time when only a minority even of well-to-do laymen could
write with any facility.</p>

<p>There was no principle and no form of action in English law
which recognized any general duty of keeping promises. But
could not breach of faith by which a party had suffered be
treated as some kind of legal wrong? There was a known action
of trespass and a known action of deceit, this last of a special
kind, mostly for what would now be called abuse of the process
of the court; but in the later middle ages it was an admitted
remedy for giving a false warranty on a sale of goods. Also
there was room for actions &ldquo;on the case,&rdquo; on facts analogous
to those covered by the old writs, though not precisely within
their terms. If the king&rsquo;s judges were to capture this important
branch of business from the clerical hands which threatened to
engross it, the only way was to devise some new form of action
on the case. There were signs, moreover, that the court of
chancery would not neglect so promising a field if the common
law judges left it open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>37</span></p>

<p>The mere fact of unfulfilled promise was not enough, in the
eyes of medieval English lawyers, to give a handle to the law.
But injury caused by reliance on another man&rsquo;s undertaking
<span class="sidenote">Assumpsit.</span>
was different. The special undertaking or
&ldquo;assumption&rdquo; creates a duty which is broken by fraudulent
or incompetent miscarriage in the performance. I profess to be
a skilled farrier, and lame your horse. It is no trespass, because
you trusted the horse to me; but it is something like a trespass,
and very like a deceit. I profess to be a competent builder; you
employ me to build a house, and I scamp the work so that the
house is not fit to live in. An action on the case was allowed
without much difficulty for such defaults. The next step, and
a long one, was to provide for total failure to perform. The
builder, instead of doing bad work, does nothing at all within
the time agreed upon for completing the house. Can it be said
that he has done a wrong? At first the judges felt bound to
hold that this was going too far; but suitors anxious to have
the benefit of the king&rsquo;s justice persevered, and in the course
of the 15th century the new form of action, called <i>assumpsit</i> from
the statement of the defendant&rsquo;s undertaking on which it was
founded, was allowed as a remedy for non-performance as well
as for faulty performance. Being an action for damages, and
not for a certain amount, it escaped the strict rules of proof
which applied to the old action of debt; being in form for a kind
of trespass, and thus a privileged appeal to the king to do right
for a breach of his peace, it escaped likewise the risk of the
defendant clearing himself by oath according to the ancient
popular procedure. Hence, as time went on, suitors were emboldened
to use &ldquo;assumpsit&rdquo; as an alternative for debt, though
it had been introduced only for cases where there was no other
remedy. By the end of the 16th century they got their way;
and it became a settled doctrine that the existence of a debt
was enough for the court to presume an undertaking to pay it.
The new form of action was made to cover the whole ground
of informal contracts, and, by extremely ingenious devices of
pleading, developed from the presumption or fiction that a man
had promised to pay what he ought, it was extended in time
to a great variety of cases where there was in fact no contract
at all.</p>

<p>The new system gave no new force to gratuitous promises.
For it was assumed, as the foundation of the jurisdiction, that
the plaintiff had been induced by the defendant&rsquo;s
<span class="sidenote">Consideration.</span>
undertaking, and with the defendant&rsquo;s consent, to
alter his position for the worse in some way. He had
paid or bound himself to pay money, he had parted with goods,
he had spent time in labour, or he had foregone some profit or
legal right. If he had not committed himself to anything on the
strength of the defendant&rsquo;s promise, he had suffered no damage
and had no cause of action. Disappointment of expectations
is unpleasant, but it is not of itself <i>damnum</i> in a legal sense. To
sum up the effect of this in modern language, the plaintiff must
have given value of some kind, more or less, for the defendant&rsquo;s
undertaking. This something given by the promisee and accepted
by the promisor in return for his undertaking is what we now
call the <i>consideration</i> for the promise. In cases where debt
would also lie, it coincides with the old requirement of value
received (<i>quid pro quo</i>) as a condition of the action of debt being
available. But the conception is far wider, for the consideration
for a promise need not be anything capable of delivery or
possession. It may be money or goods; but it may also be an
act or series of acts; further (and this is of the first importance
for our modern law), it may itself be a promise to pay money or
deliver goods, or to do work, or otherwise to act or not to act in
some specified way. Again, it need not be anything which is
obviously for the promisor&rsquo;s benefit. His acceptance shows
that he set some value on it; but in truth the promisee&rsquo;s burden,
and not the promisor&rsquo;s benefit, is material. The last refinement
of holding that, when mutual promises are exchanged between
parties, each promise is a consideration for the other and makes
it binding, was conclusively accepted only in the 17th century.
The result was that promises of mere bounty could no more be
enforced than before, but any kind of lawful bargain could;
and there is no reason to doubt that this was in substance what
most men wanted. Ancient popular usage and feeling show
little more encouragement than ancient law itself to merely
gratuitous alienation or obligations. Also (subject, till quite
modern times, to the general rule of common-law procedure
that parties could not be their own witnesses, and subject to
various modern statutory requirements in various classes of
cases) no particular kind of proof was necessary. The necessity
of consideration for the validity of simple contracts was unfortunately
confused by commentators, almost from the beginning
of its history, with the perfectly different rules of the Roman
law about <i>nudum pactum</i>, which very few English lawyers took
the pains to understand. Hasty comparison of misunderstood
Roman law, sometimes in its civil and sometimes in its ecclesiastical
form, is answerable for a large proportion of the worst
faults in old-fashioned text-books. Doubtless many canonists,
probably some common lawyers, and possibly some of the judges
of the Renaissance time, supposed that <i>ex nudo pacio non oritur
actio</i> was in some way a proposition of universal reason; but it
is a long way from this to concluding that the Roman law had
any substantial influence on the English.</p>

<p>The doctrine of consideration is in fact peculiar to those
jurisdictions where the common law of England is in force, or
is the foundation of the received law, or, as in South Africa, has
made large encroachments upon it in practice. Substantially
similar results are obtained in other modern systems by professing
to enforce all deliberate promises, but imposing stricter conditions
of proof where the promise is gratuitous.</p>

<p>As obligations embodied in the solemn form of a deed were
thereby made enforceable before the doctrine of consideration
was known, so they still remain. When a man has
<span class="sidenote">Deeds.</span>
by deed declared himself bound, there is no need to
look for any bargain, or even to ask whether the other party
has assented. This rugged fragment of ancient law remains
embedded in our elaborate modern structure. Nevertheless
gratuitous promises, even by deed, get only their strict and bare
rights. There may be an action upon them, but the powerful
remedy of specific performance&mdash;often the only one worth
having&mdash;is denied them. For this is derived from the extraordinary
jurisdiction of the chancellor, and the equity administered
by the chancellor was not for plaintiffs who could
not show substantial merit as well as legal claims. The singular
position of promises made by deed is best left out of account
in considering the general doctrine of the formation of contracts;
and as to interpretation there is no difference. In what follows,
therefore, it will be needless, as a rule, to distinguish between
&ldquo;parol&rdquo; or &ldquo;simple&rdquo; contracts, that is, contracts not made by
deed, and obligations undertaken by deed.</p>

<p>From the conception of a promise being valid only when
given in return for something accepted in consideration of
the promise, it follows that the giving of the promise
<span class="sidenote">Promise and offer.</span>
and of the consideration must be simultaneous. Words
of promise uttered before there is a consideration for
them can be no more than an offer; and, on the other hand, the
obligation declared in words, or inferred from acts and conduct, on
the acceptance of a consideration, is fixed at that time, and cannot
be varied by subsequent declaration, though such declarations
may be material as admissions. It was a long while, however,
before this consequence was clearly perceived. In the 18th
century it was attempted, and for a time with considerable
success, to extend the range of enforceable promises without
regard to what the principles of the law would bear, in order
to satisfy a sense of natural justice. This movement was checked
only within living memory, and traces of it remain in certain
apparently anomalous rules which are indeed of little practical
importance, but which private writers, at any rate, cannot
safely treat as obsolete. However, the question of &ldquo;past
consideration&rdquo; is too minute and technical to be pursued here.
The general result is that a binding contract is regularly constituted
by the acceptance of an offer, and at the moment when it
is accepted; and, however complicated the transaction may be,
there must always, in the theory of English law, be such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>38</span>
moment in every case where a contract is formed. It also
follows that an offer before acceptance creates no duty of any
kind (&ldquo;A revocable promise is unknown to our law&rdquo;&mdash;Anson);
which is by no means necessarily the case in systems where
the English rule of consideration is unknown. The question
what amounts to final acceptance of an offer is, on the other
hand, a question ultimately depending on common sense, and
must be treated on similar lines in all civilized countries where
the business of life is carried on in a generally similar way. The
rules that an offer is understood to be made only for a reasonable
time, according to the nature of the case, and lapses if not
accepted in due time; that an expressed revocation of an offer
can take effect only if communicated to the other party before
he has accepted; that acceptance of an offer must be according
to its terms, and a conditional or qualified acceptance is only
a new proposal, and the like, may be regarded as standing on
general convenience as much as on any technical ground.</p>

<p>Great difficulties have arisen, and in other systems as well
as in the English, as to the completion of contracts between
persons at a distance. There must be some rule, and
<span class="sidenote">Correspondence.</span>
yet any rule that can be framed must seem arbitrary
in some cases. On the whole the modern doctrine
is to some such effect as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The proposer of a contract can prescribe or authorize any
mode, or at least any reasonable mode, of acceptance, and if he
specifies none he is deemed to authorize the use of any reasonable
mode in common use, and especially the post. Acceptance in
words is not always required; an offer may be well accepted
by an act clearly referable to the proposed agreement, and
constituting the whole or part of the performance asked for&mdash;say
the despatch of goods in answer to an order by post, or the
doing of work bespoken; and it seems that in such cases further
communication&mdash;unless expressly requested&mdash;is not necessary
as matter of law, however prudent and desirable it may be.
Where a promise and not an act is sought (as where a tradesman
writes a letter offering goods for sale on credit), it must be
communicated; in the absence of special direction letter post
or telegraph may be used; and, further, the acceptor having
done his part when his answer is committed to the post. English
courts now hold (after much discussion and doubt) that any
delay or miscarriage in course of post is at the proposer&rsquo;s risk,
so that a man may be bound by an acceptance he never received.
It is generally thought&mdash;though there is no English decision&mdash;that,
in conformity with this last rule, a revocation by telegraph
of an acceptance already posted would be inoperative. Much
more elaborate rules are laid down in some continental codes.
It seems doubtful whether their complication achieves any gain
of substantial justice worth the price. At first sight it looks
easy to solve some of the difficulties by admitting an interval
during which one party is bound and the other not. But, apart
from the risk of starting fresh problems as hard as the old ones,
English principles, as above said, require a contract to be concluded
between the parties at one point of time, and any exception
to this would have to be justified by very strong grounds of
expediency. We have already assumed, but it should be specifically
stated, that neither offers nor acceptances are confined to
communications made in spoken or written words. Acts or
signs may and constantly do signify proposal and assent. One
does not in terms request a ferryman to put one across the river.
Stepping into the boat is an offer to pay the usual fare for being
ferried over, and the ferryman accepts it by putting off. This is
a very simple case, but the principle is the same in all cases.
Acts fitted to convey to a reasonable man the proposal of an
agreement, or the acceptance of a proposal he has made, are as
good in law as equivalent express words. The term &ldquo;implied
contract&rdquo; is current in this connexion, but it is unfortunately
ambiguous. It sometimes means a contract concluded by acts,
not words, of one or both parties, but still a real agreement;
sometimes an obligation imposed by law where there is not any
agreement in fact, for which the name &ldquo;quasi-contract&rdquo; is
more appropriate and now usual.</p>

<p>The obligation of contract is an obligation created and determined
by the will of the parties. Herein is the characteristic
difference of contract from all other branches of law.
<span class="sidenote">Interpretation.</span>
The business of the law, therefore, is to give effect so
far as possible to the intention of the parties, and all
the rules for interpreting contracts go back to this fundamental
principle and are controlled by it. Every one knows that its
application is not always obvious. Parties often express themselves
obscurely; still oftener they leave large parts of their
intention unexpressed, or (which for the law is the same thing)
have not formed any intention at all as to what is to be done
in certain events. But even where the law has to fill up gaps by
judicial conjecture, the guiding principle still is, or ought to be,
the consideration of what either party has given the other
reasonable cause to expect of him. The court aims not at
imposing terms on the parties, but at fixing the terms left blank
as the parties would or reasonably might have fixed them if all
the possibilities had been clearly before their minds. For this
purpose resort must be had to various tests: the court may
look to the analogy of what the parties have expressly provided
in case of other specified events, to the constant or general
usage of persons engaged in like business, and, at need, ultimately
to the court&rsquo;s own sense of what is just and expedient. All
auxiliary rules of this kind are subject to the actual will of the
parties, and are applied only for want of sufficient declaration
of it by the parties themselves. A rule which can take effect
against the judicially known will of the parties is not a rule of
construction or interpretation, but a positive rule of law. However
artificial some rules of construction may seem, this test
will always hold. In modern times the courts have avoided
laying down new rules of construction, preferring to keep a free
hand and deal with each case on its merits as a whole. It should
be observed that the fulfilment of a contract may create a
relation between the parties which, once established, is governed
by fixed rules of law not variable by the preceding agreement.
Marriage is the most conspicuous example of this, and perhaps
the only complete one in our modern law.</p>

<p>There are certain rules of evidence which to some extent
guide or restrain interpretation. In particular, oral testimony
is not allowed to vary the terms of an agreement
<span class="sidenote">Evidence.</span>
reduced to writing. This is really in aid of the parties&rsquo;
deliberate intention, for the object of reducing terms to writing
is to make them certain. There are apparent exceptions to the
rule, of which the most conspicuous is the admission of evidence
to show that words were used in a special meaning current in
the place or trade in question. But they are reducible, it will be
found, to applications (perhaps over-subtle in some cases) of
the still more general principles that, before giving legal force
to a document, we must know that it is really what it purports
to be, and that when we do give effect to it according to its
terms we must be sure of what its terms really say. The rules
of evidence here spoken of are modern, and have nothing to do
with the archaic rule already mentioned as to the effect of a deed.</p>

<p>Every contracting party is bound to perform his promise
according to its terms, and in case of any doubt in the sense
in which the other party would reasonably understand
<span class="sidenote">Performance.</span>
the promise. Where the performance on one or both
sides extends over an appreciable time, continuously
or by instalments, questions may arise as to the right of either
party to refuse or suspend further performance on the ground
of some default on the other side. Attempts to lay down hard
and fast rules on such questions are now discouraged, the aim
of the courts being to give effect to the true substance and intent
of the contract in every case. Nor will the court hold one part
of the terms deliberately agreed to more or less material than
another in modern business dealings. &ldquo;In the contracts of
merchants time is of the essence,&rdquo; as the Supreme Court of the
United States has said in our own day. Certain ancient rules
restraining the apparent literal effect of common provisions
in mortgages and other instruments were in truth controlling
rules of policy. New rules of this kind can be made only by
legislation. Whether the parties did or did not in fact intend
the obligation of a contract to be subject to unexpressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>39</span>
conditions is, however, a possible and not uncommon question of
interpretation. One class of cases giving rise to such questions
is that in which performance becomes impossible by some
external cause not due to the promisor&rsquo;s own fault; a similar
but not identical one is that in which the agreement could be
literally performed, and yet the performance would not give
the promisor the substance of what he bargained for; as
happened in the &ldquo;coronation cases&rdquo; arising out of the postponement
of the king&rsquo;s coronation in 1902. As to promises
obviously absurd or impossible from the first, they are unenforceable
only on the ground that the parties cannot have
seriously meant to create a liability. For precisely the same
reason, supported by the general usage and understanding of
mankind, common social engagements, though they often fulfil
all other requisites of a contract, have never been treated as
binding in law.</p>

<p>In all matters of contract, as we have said, the ascertained
will of the parties prevails. But this means a will both lawful
and free. Hence there are limits to the force of the
<span class="sidenote">Illegality.</span>
general rule, fixed partly by the law of the land, which
is above individual will and interests, partly by the need of
securing good faith and justice between the parties themselves
against fraud or misadventure. Agreements cannot be enforced
when their performance would involve an offence against the
law. There may be legal offence, it must be remembered, not
only in acts commonly recognized as criminal, disloyal or
immoral, but in the breach or non-observance of positive regulations
made by the legislature, or persons having statutory
authority, for a great variety of purposes. It would be useless
to give details on the subject here. Again, there are cases where
an agreement may be made and performed without offending
the law, but on grounds of &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; it is not thought
right that the performance should be a matter of legal obligation,
even if the ordinary conditions of an enforceable contract are
satisfied. A man may bet, in private at any rate, if he likes,
and pay or receive as the event may be; but for many years
the winner has had no right of action against the loser. Unfortunate
timidity on the part of the judges, who attempted
to draw distinctions instead of saying boldly that they would
not entertain actions on wagers of any kind, threw this topic
into the domain of legislation; and the laudable desire of
parliament to discourage gambling, so far as might be, without
attempting impossible prohibitions, has brought the law to a
state of ludicrous complexity in both civil and criminal jurisdiction.
But what is really important under this doctrine of public
policy is the confinement of &ldquo;contracts in restraint of trade&rdquo;
within special limits. In the middle ages and down to modern
times there was a strong feeling&mdash;not merely an artificial legal
doctrine&mdash;against monopolies and everything tending to monopoly.
Agreements to keep up prices or not to compete were
regarded as criminal. Gradually it was found that some kind of
limited security against competition must be allowed if such
transactions as the sale of a going concern with its goodwill,
or the retirement of partners from a continuing firm, or the
employment of confidential servants in matters involving trade
secrets, were to be carried on to the satisfaction of the parties.
Attempts to lay down fixed rules in these matters were made
from time to time, but they were finally discredited by the
decision of the House of Lords in the Maxim-Nordenfelt Company&rsquo;s
case in 1894. Contracts &ldquo;in restraint of trade&rdquo; will now
be held valid, provided that they are made for valuable consideration
(this even if they are made by deed), and do not go beyond
what can be thought reasonable for the protection of the interests
concerned, and are not injurious to the public. (The Indian
Contract Act, passed in 1872, has unfortunately embodied
views now obsolete, and remains unamended.) All that remains
of the old rules in England is the necessity of valuable consideration,
whatever be the form of the contract, and a strong presumption&mdash;but
not an absolute rule of law&mdash;that an unqualified
agreement not to carry on a particular business is not
reasonable.</p>

<p>Where there is no reason in the nature of the contract for not
enforcing it, the consent of a contracting party may still not be
binding on him because not given with due knowledge, or, if he
is in a relation of dependence to the other party, with independent
judgment. Inducing a man by deceit to enter into a
<span class="sidenote">Fraud.</span>
contract may always be treated by the deceived party
as a ground for avoiding his obligation, if he does so
within a reasonable time after discovering the truth, and, in
particular, before any innocent third person has acquired rights
for value on the faith of the contract (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fraud</a></span>). Coercion
would be treated on principle in the same way as fraud, but
such cases hardly occur in modern times. There is a kind of
moral domination, however, which our courts watch with the
utmost jealousy, and repress under the name of &ldquo;undue influence&rdquo;
when it is used to obtain pecuniary advantage. Persons in a
position of legal or practical authority&mdash;guardians, confidential
advisers, spiritual directors, and the like&mdash;must not abuse their
authority for selfish ends. They are not forbidden to take
benefits from those who depend on them or put their trust in
them; but if they do, and the givers repent of their bounty,
the whole burden of proof is on the takers to show that the gift
was in the first instance made freely and with understanding.
Large voluntary gifts or beneficial contracts, outside the limits
within which natural affection and common practice justify
them, are indeed not encouraged in any system of civilized
law. Professional money lenders were formerly checked by
the usury law: since those laws were repealed in 1854, courts
and juries have shown a certain astuteness in applying the
rules of law as to fraud and undue influence&mdash;the latter with
certain special features&mdash;to transactions with needy &ldquo;expectant
heirs&rdquo; and other improvident persons which seem on the whole
unconscionable. The Money Lenders Act of 1900 has fixed
and (as finally interpreted by the House of Lords) also sharpened
these developments. In the case of both fraud and undue
influence, the person entitled to avoid a contract may, if so
advised, ratify it afterwards; and ratification, if made with
full knowledge and free judgment, is irrevocable. A contract
made with a person deprived by unsound mind or intoxication
of the capacity to form a rational judgment is on the same
footing as a contract obtained by fraud, if the want of capacity
is apparent to the other party.</p>

<p>There are many cases in which a statement made by one party to
the other about a material fact will enable the other to avoid the
contract if he has relied on it, and it was in fact untrue,
though it may have been made at the time with honest
<span class="sidenote">Misrepresentation.</span>
belief in its truth. This is so wherever, according to the
common course of business, it is one party&rsquo;s business to know
the facts, and the other practically must, or reasonably may,
take the facts from him. In some classes of cases even inadvertent
omission to disclose any material fact is treated as a misrepresentation.
Contracts of insurance are the most important;
here the insurer very seldom has the means of making any
effective inquiry of his own. Misdescription of real property
on a sale, without fraud, may according to its importance be
a matter for compensation or for setting aside the contract.
Promoters of companies are under special duties as to good faith
and disclosure which have been worked out at great length in
the modern decisions. But company law has become so complex
within the present generation that, so far from throwing much
light on larger principles, it is hardly intelligible without some
previous grasp of them. Sometimes it is said that misrepresentation
(apart from fraud) of any material fact will serve to
avoid any and every kind of contract. It is submitted that this
is certainly not the law as to the sale of goods or as to the contract
to marry, and therefore the alleged rule cannot be laid down
as universal. But it must be remembered that parties can, if
they please, and not necessarily by the express terms of the
contract itself, make the validity of their contract conditional
on the existence of any matter of fact whatever, including the
correctness of any particular statement. If they have done this,
and the fact is not so, the contract has no force; not because
there has been a misrepresentation, but because the parties
agreed to be bound if the fact was so and not otherwise. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>40</span>
a question of interpretation whether in a given case there was
any such condition.</p>

<p>Mistake is said to be a ground for avoiding contracts, and there
are cases which it is practically convenient to group under this
head. On principle they seem to be mostly reducible to
<span class="sidenote">Mistake.</span>
failure of the acceptance to correspond with the offer, or
absence of any real consideration for the promise. In such cases,
whether there be fraud or not, no contract is ever formed, and
therefore there is nothing which can be ratified&mdash;a distinction
which may have important effects. Relief against mistake is
given where parties who have really agreed, or rather their
advisers, fail to express their intention correctly. Here, if the
original true intention is fully proved&mdash;as to which the court
is rightly cautious&mdash;the faulty document can be judicially
rectified.</p>

<p>By the common law an infant (<i>i.e.</i> a person less than twenty-one
years old) was bound by contracts made for &ldquo;necessaries,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
such commodities as a jury holds, and the court thinks
<span class="sidenote">Disability.</span>
they may reasonably hold, suitable and required for
the person&rsquo;s condition; also by contracts otherwise clearly for
his benefit; all other contracts he might confirm or avoid after
coming of age. An extremely ill-drawn act of 1874 absolutely
deprived infants of the power of contracting loans, contracting
for the supply of goods other than necessaries, and stating an
account so as to bind themselves; it also disabled them from
binding themselves by ratification. The liability for necessaries
is now declared by legislative authority in the Sale of Goods Act
1893; the modern doctrine is that it is in no case a true liability
on contract. There is an obligation imposed by law to pay, not
the agreed price, but a reasonable price. Practically, people
who give credit to an infant do so at their peril, except in cases
of obvious urgency.</p>

<p>Married women were incapable by the common law of contracting
in their own names. At this day they can hold separate
property and bind themselves to the extent of that property&mdash;not
personally&mdash;by contract. The law before the Married
Women&rsquo;s Property Acts (1882 and 1893, and earlier acts now
superseded and repealed) was a very peculiar creature of the
court of chancery; the number of cases in which it is necessary
to go back to it is of course decreasing year by year. But a
married woman can still be restrained from anticipating the
income of her separate property, and the restriction is still
commonly inserted in marriage settlements.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of philosophical interest about the nature
and capacities of corporations, but for modern practical purposes
it may be said that the legal powers of British corporations are
directly or indirectly determined by acts of parliament. For
companies under the Companies Acts the controlling instrument
or written constitution is the memorandum of association.
Company draftsmen, taught by experience, nowadays frame
this in the most comprehensive terms. Questions of either
personal or corporate disability are less frequent than they
were. In any case they stand apart from the general principles
which characterize our law of contract.</p>

<p>The rights created by contract are personal rights against the
promisors and their legal representatives, and therefore different
in kind from the rights of ownership and the like
<span class="sidenote">Contract and property.</span>
which are available against all the world. Nevertheless
they may be and very commonly are capable of
pecuniary estimation and estimated as part of a man&rsquo;s
assets. Book debts are the most obvious example. Such rights
are property in the larger sense: they are in modern law transmissible
and alienable, unless the contract is of a kind implying
personal confidence, or a contrary intention is otherwise shown.
The rights created by negotiable instruments are an important
and unique species of property, being not only exchangeable
but the very staple of commercial currency. Contract and
conveyance, again, are distinct in their nature, and sharply
distinguished in the classical Roman law. But in the common
law property in goods is transferred by a complete contract of
sale without any further act, and under the French civil code
and systems which have followed it a like rule applies not only
to movables but to immovables. In English law procuring a
man to break his contract is a civil wrong against the other
contracting party, subject to exceptions which are still not
clearly defined.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTRADICTION, PRINCIPLE OF</span> (<i>principium contradictionis</i>),
in logic, the term applied to the second of the three
primary &ldquo;laws of thought.&rdquo; The oldest statement of the law
is that contradictory statements cannot both at the same time
be true, <i>e.g.</i> the two propositions &ldquo;A is B&rdquo; and &ldquo;A is not B&rdquo;
are mutually exclusive. A may be B at one time, and not at
another; A may be partly B and partly not B at the same time;
but it is impossible to predicate of the same thing, at the same
time, and in the same sense, the absence and the presence of the
same quality. This is the statement of the law given by Aristotle
(<span class="grk" title="to gar auto huparchein te kai mê huparchein adunaton tô autô
kai kata to auto">&#964;&#8056; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#949; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8052; &#8017;&#960;&#940;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#7936;&#948;&#973;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#964;&#8056; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;</span>, <i>Metaph.</i> &Gamma; 3, 1005 b 19). It takes no
account of the truth of either proposition; if one is true, the
other is not; one of the two must be true.</p>

<p>Modern logicians, following Leibnitz and Kant, have generally
adopted a different statement, by which the law assumes an
essentially different meaning. Their formula is &ldquo;A is not
not-A&rdquo;; in other words it is impossible to predicate of a thing
a quality which is its contradictory. Unlike Aristotle&rsquo;s law
this law deals with the necessary relation between subject and
predicate in a single judgment. Whereas Aristotle states that
<i>one or other</i> of two contradictory propositions must be false,
the Kantian law states that a particular kind of proposition is
<i>in itself</i> necessarily false. On the other hand there is a real
connexion between the two laws. The denial of the statement
&ldquo;A is not-A&rdquo; presupposes some knowledge of what A is, <i>i.e.</i>
the statement A is A. In other words a judgment about A is
implied. Kant&rsquo;s analytical propositions depend on presupposed
concepts which are the same for all people. His statement,
regarded as a logical principle purely and apart from material
facts, does not therefore amount to more than that of Aristotle,
which deals simply with the significance of negation.</p>

<p>There are at the present day three distinct makes of contrafagotto.
(1) The modern German (fig. 1) is founded on the
older models, resembling
the bassoon, the best-known
being Heckel&rsquo;s of
Biebrich-am-Rhein, used
at Bayreuth and in many
German orchestras. In
this model the characteristics
of the bassoon are
preserved, and the tone
is of true fagotto quality
extended in its lower
register. The Heckel contrafagotto
consists of a
wooden tube 16 ft. 4 in.
long with a conical bore,
and doubled back four
times upon itself to make
it less unwieldy. It is
thus about the same
length as the bassoon and
terminates in a bell 4 in.
in diameter pointing
downwards. The crook
consists of a small brass
tube about 2 ft. long,
having a very narrow bore,
to which is bound the
double-reed mouthpiece.
(2) The modern English
double bassoon is one
designed by Dr W. H.
Stone, and made under
his superintendence by
Haseneier of Coblenz. It
is stated that instruments
of this pattern are less
fatiguing to blow than
those resembling the bassoon.
The bore is truly
conical, starting with a
diameter of ¼ in. at the reed and ending in a diameter of
4 in. at the open end of the tube which points upwards and has
no defined bell, being merely finished with a rim. Alfred Morton,
in England, has constructed double bassoons on Dr Stone&rsquo;s
design (fig. 2). (3) The third model is of brass and consists of
a conical tube of wide calibre some 15 or 16 ft. long, curved
round four times upon itself and having a brass tuba or euphonium
bell which points upwards. This brass model, usually known
as the Belgian or French (fig. 3), was really of Austrian origin,
having been first introduced by Schöllnast of Presburg about
1839. B. F. Czerveny of Königgrätz and Victor Mahillon of
Brussels both appear to have followed up this idea independently;
the former producing a metal contrafagotto in E&#9837; in 1856 and one
in B&#9837; which he called sub-contrafagotto in 1867, while Mahillon&rsquo;s
was ready in 1868. In the brass contrafagotto the lateral holes
are pierced at theoretically correct intervals along the bore, and
have a diameter almost equal to the section of the bore at the
point where the hole is pierced. The octave harmonic only is
obtainable on this instrument owing to the great length of the
bore and its large calibre. There are therefore two octave keys
which give a chromatic compass

<p>The modern wooden contrafagotto has a pitch one octave
below that of the bassoon and three below that of the oboe; its
compass extending from 16 ft. C. to middle C. The harmonics
of the octave in the middle register and of the 12th in the upper
register are obtained by skilful manipulation of the reed with
the lips and increased pressure of the breath. The notes of both
extremes are difficult to produce.</p>

<p>Although the double bassoon is not a transposing instrument
the music for it is written an octave higher than the real sounds
in order to avoid the ledger lines. The quality of tone is somewhat
rough and rattling in the lowest register, the volume of
sound not being quite adequate considering the depth of the pitch.
In the middle and upper registers the tone of the wooden contrafagotto
possesses all the characteristics of the bassoon. The
contrafagotto has a complete chromatic compass, and it may
therefore be played in any key. Quick passages are avoided
since they would be neither easy nor effective, the instrument
being essentially a slow-speaking one. The lowest notes are only
possible to a good player, and cannot be obtained <i>piano</i>; nevertheless,
the instrument forms a fine bass to the reed family, and
supplies in the orchestra the notes missing in the double bass
in order to reach 16 ft. C.</p>

<div class="condenced">
<p>The origin of the contrafagotto, like that of the oboe (<i>q.v.</i>) must be
sought in the highest antiquity (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aulos</a></span>). Its immediate forerunner
was the double bombard or bombardino or the great double quintpommer
whose compass extended downwards to E
<img style="border:0; width:140px; height:82px"
     src="images/img41c.jpg"
     alt="" /></p>

<p>It is not known precisely when the change took place, though it was
probably soon after the transformation of the bassoon, but Handel
scored for the instrument and it was used in military bands before
being adopted in the orchestra. The original instrument made for
Handel by T. Stanesby, junior, and played by J. F. Lampe at the
Marylebone Gardens in 1739, was exhibited at the Royal Military
Exhibition, London, in 1890. Owing to its faulty construction and
weak rattling tone the double bassoon fell into disuse, in spite of the
fact that the great composers Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven scored
for it abundantly; the last used it in the C minor and choral symphonies
and wrote an <i>obbligato</i> for it in <i>Fidelio</i>. It was restored to
favour in England by Dr W. H. Stone.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTRALTO</span> (from Ital. <i>contra-alto</i>, <i>i.e.</i> next above the alto),
the term for the lowest variety of the female voice, as distinguished

<p><span class="bold">CONTRAPUNTAL FORMS</span>, in Music. The forms of music
may be considered in two aspects, the texture of the music from
moment to moment, and the shape of the musical design as a
whole. Historically the texture of music became definitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>42</span>
organized long before the shape could be determined by any
but external or mechanical conceptions. The laws of musical
texture were known as the laws of &ldquo;counterpoint&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Counterpoint</a></span>
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harmony</a></span>). The &ldquo;contrapuntal&rdquo; forms, then,
are historically the earliest and aesthetically the simplest in
music; the simplest, that is to say, in principle, but not necessarily
the easiest to appreciate or to execute. Their simplicity
is like that of mathematics, the simplicity of the elements
involved; but the intricacy of their details and the subtlety
of their expression may easily pass the limits of popularity,
while art of a much more complex nature may masquerade in
popular guise; just as mathematical science is seldom popularized,
while biology masquerades in infant schools as &ldquo;natural
history.&rdquo; Here, however, the resemblance between counterpoint
and mathematics ends, for the simplicity of genuine contrapuntal
style is a simplicity of emotion as well as of principle; and if
the style has a popular reputation of being severe and abstruse,
this is largely because the popular conception of emotion is
conventional and dependent upon an excessive amount of
external nervous stimulus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>1. Canonic Forms and Devices.</i></p>

<p>In the <i>canonic</i> forms, the earliest known in music as an independent
art, the laws of texture also determine the shape of the
whole, so that it is impossible, except in the light of historical
knowledge, to say which is prior to the other. The principle
of canon being that one voice shall reproduce the material of
another note for note, it follows that in a composition where
all parts are canonic and where the material of the leading part
consists of a pre-determined melody, such as a Gregorian chant
or a popular song there remains no room for further consideration
of the shape of the work. Hence, quite apart from their
expressive power and their value in teaching composers to attain
harmonic fluency under difficulties, the canonic forms played
the leading part in the music of the 15th and 16th centuries;
nor indeed have they since fallen into neglect without grave
injury to the art. But strict canon soon proved inadequate,
and even dangerous, as the sole regulating principle in music;
and its rival and cognate principle, the basing of polyphonic
designs upon a given melody to which one part (generally the
tenor) was confined, proved scarcely less so. Nor were these
two principles, the canon and the <i>canto fermo</i>, likely, by combination
in their strictest forms, to produce better artistic
results than separately. Both were rigid and mechanical
principles; and their development into real artistic devices
was due, not to a mere increase in the facility of their use, but
to the fact that, just as the researches of alchemists led to the
foundations of chemistry, so did the early musical puzzles lead
to the discovery of innumerable harmonic and melodic resources
which have that variety and freedom of interaction which can
be organized into true works of art and can give the ancient
mechanical devices themselves a genuine artistic character
attainable by no other means.</p>

<p>The earliest canonic form is the <i>rondel</i> or <i>rota</i> as practised
in the 12th century. It is, however, canonic by accident rather
than in its original intention. It consists of a combination of
short melodies in several voices, each melody being sung by
each voice in turn. Now it is obvious that if one voice began
alone, instead of all together, and if when it went on to the
second melody the second voice entered with the first, and so on,
the result would be a canon in the unison. Thus the difference
between the crude counterpoint of the rondel and a strict canon
in the unison is a mere question of the point at which the composition
begins, and a 12th century rondel is simply a canon at
the unison begun at the point where all the voices have already
entered. There is some reason to believe that one kind of rondeau
practised by Adam de la Hale was intended to be sung in the
true canonic manner of the modern round; and the wonderful
English rota, &ldquo;Sumer is icumen in,&rdquo; shows in the upper four
parts the true canonic method, and in its two-part <i>pes</i> the
method in which the parts began together. In these archaic
works the canonic form gives the whole a consistency and stability
contrasting oddly with the dismal warfare between nascent
harmonic principles and ancient anti-harmonic criteria which
hopelessly wrecks them as regards euphony. As soon as harmony
became established on a true artistic basis, the unaccompanied
round took the position of a trivial but refined art-form, with
hardly more expressive possibilities than the triolet in poetry, a
form to which its brevity and lightness renders it fairly comparable.
Orlando di Lasso&rsquo;s <i>Célébrons sans cesse</i> is a beautiful
example of the 16th century round, which was at that time
little cultivated by serious musicians. In more modern times
the possibilities of the round in its purest form have enormously
increased; and with the aid of elaborate instrumental accompaniments
it plays an important feature in such portions of
classical operatic <i>ensemble</i> as can with dramatic propriety be
devoted to expressions of feeling uninterrupted by dramatic
action. In the modern round the first voice can execute a long
and complete melody before the second voice joins in. Even if
this melody be not instrumentally accompanied, it will imply
a certain harmony, or at all events arouse curiosity as to what
the harmony is to be. And the sequel may shed a new light
upon the harmony, and thus by degrees the whole character
of the melody may be transformed. The power of the modern
round for humorous and subtle, or even profound, expression
was first fully revealed by Mozart, whose astounding unaccompanied
canons would be better known if he had not unfortunately
set many of them to extemporized texts unfit for publication.
The round or the <i>catch</i> (which is simply a specially jocose round)
is a favourite English art-form, and the English specimens of
it are probably more numerous and uniformly successful than
those of any other nation. Still they cannot honestly be said
to realize the full possibilities of the form. It is so easy to write
a good piece of free and fairly contrapuntal harmony in three or
more parts, and so arrange it that it remains correct when the
parts are brought in one by one, that very few composers seem
to have realized that any further artistic device was possible
within such limits. Even Cherubini gives hardly more than a
valuable hint that the round may be more than a <i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i>;
and, unless he be an adequate exception, the unaccompanied
rounds of Mozart and Brahms stand alone as works that raise
the round to the dignity of a serious art-form. With the addition
of an orchestral accompaniment the round obviously becomes
a larger thing; and when we consider such specimens as that
in the finale of Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Cosi fan tutte</i>, the quartet in the last
act of Cherubim&rsquo;s <i>Faniska</i>, the wonderfully subtle quartet
&ldquo;Mir ist so wunderbar&rdquo; in Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Fidelio</i>, and the very
beautiful numbers in Schubert&rsquo;s masses where Schubert finds
expression for his genuine contrapuntal feeling without incurring
the risks resulting from his lack of training in fugue-form, we
find that the length of the initial melody, the growing variety
of the orchestral accompaniment and the finality and climax
of the free coda, combine to give the whole a character closely
analogous to that of a set of contrapuntal variations, such as
the slow movement of Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Emperor&rdquo; string quartet, or
the opening of the finale of Beethoven&rsquo;s 9th Symphony. Berlioz
is fond of beginning his largest movements like a kind of round;
<i>e.g.</i> his <i>Dies Irae</i>, and <i>Scène aux Champs</i>.</p>

<p>A moment&rsquo;s reflection will show that three conditions are
necessary to make a canon into a round. First, the voices
must imitate each other in the unison; secondly, they must
enter at equal intervals of time; and thirdly, the whole melodic
material must be as many times longer than the interval of time
as the number of voices; otherwise, when the last voice has
finished the first phrase, the first voice will not be ready to return
to the beginning. Strict canon is, however, possible under
innumerable other conditions, and even a round is possible with
some of the voices at the interval of an octave, as is of course
inevitable in writing for unequal voices. And in a round for
unequal voices there is obviously a new means of effect in the
fact that, as the melody rotates, its different parts change
their pitch in relation to each other. The art by which this is
possible without incorrectness is that of double, triple and
multiple counterpoint (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Counterpoint</a></span>). Its difficulty is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>43</span>
variable, and with an instrumental accompaniment there is
none. In fugues, multiple counterpoint is one of the normal
resources of music; and few devices are more self-explanatory
to the ear than the process by which the subject and counter-subjects
of a fugue change their positions, revealing fresh melodic
and acoustic aspects of identical harmonic structure at every
turn. This, however, is rendered possible and interesting by
the fact that the passages in such counterpoint are separated
by episodes and are free to appear in different keys. Many
fugues of Bach are written throughout in multiple counterpoint;
but the possibility of this, even to composers such as Bach and
Mozart, to whom difficulties seem unknown, depends upon the
freedom of the musical design which allows the composer to
select the most effective permutations and combinations of his
counterpoint, and also to put them into whatever key he chooses.
An unaccompanied round for unequal voices would bring about
the permutations and combinations in a mechanical order;
and unless the melody were restricted to a compass common to
soprano and alto each alternate revolution would carry it beyond
the bounds of one or the other group of voices. The technical
difficulties of such a problem are destructive to artistic invention.
But they do not appear in the above-mentioned operatic rounds,
though these are for unequal voices, because here the length of
the initial melody is so great that the composition is quite long
enough before the last voice has got farther than the first or
second phrase, and, moreover, the free instrumental accompaniment
is capable of furnishing a bass to a mass of harmony
otherwise incomplete.</p>

<p>The resources of canon, when emancipated from the principles
of the round, are considerable when the canonic form is strictly
maintained, and are inexhaustible when it is treated freely. A
canon need not be in the unison; and when it is in some other
interval the imitating voice alters the expression of the melody
by transferring it to another part of the scale. Again, the
imitating voice may follow the leader at any distance of time;
and thus we have obviously a definite means of expression in
the difference of closeness with which various canonic parts may
enter, as, for instance, in the stretto of a fugue. Again, if the
answering part enters on an unaccented beat where the leader
began on the accent, there will be artistic value in the resulting
difference of rhythmic expression. This is the device known
as <i>per arsin et thesin</i>. All these devices are, in skilful hands,
quite definite in their effect upon the ear, and their expressive
power is undoubtedly due to their special canonic nature. The
beauty of the pleading, rising sequences in crossing parts that
we find in the canon in the 2nd at the opening of the <i>Recordare</i>
in Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Requiem</i> is attainable by no other technical means.
The close canon in the 6th at the distance of one minim in reversed
accent in Bach&rsquo;s eighteenth <i>Goldberg</i> variation owes all
its smooth harmonic expression to the fact that the two canonic
parts move in sixths which would be simultaneous but for the
pause of the minim which reverses the accents of the upper
part while it creates that chain of suspended discords which
give harmonic variety to the whole.</p>

<p>Two other canonic devices have important artistic value,
namely, <i>augmentation</i> and <i>diminution</i> (two different aspects of
the same thing) and <i>inversion</i>. In augmentation the imitating
part sings twice as slow as the leader, or sometimes still slower.
This obviously should impart a new dignity to the melody, and
in diminution the expression is generally that of an accession
of liveliness.<a name="FnAnchor_1e" href="#Footnote_1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Neither of these devices, however, continues to
appeal to the ear if carried on for long. In augmentation the
answering part lags so far behind the leader that the ear cannot
long follow the connexion, while a diminished answer will
obviously soon overtake the leader, and can proceed on the
same plan only by itself becoming the leader of a canon in
augmentation. Beethoven, in the fugues in his sonatas <i>op.</i> 106
and 110, adapted augmentation and diminution to modern
varieties of thematic expression, by employing them in triple
time, so that, by <i>doubling</i> the length of the original notes across
this triple rhythm, they produce an entirely new rhythmic
expression. This does not seem to have been applied by any
earlier composer with the same consistency or intention.</p>

<p>The device of <i>inversion</i> consists in the imitating part reversing
every interval of the leader, ascending where the leader descends
and vice versa. Its expressive power depends upon such subtle
matters of the harmonic expression of melody that its artistic
use is one of the surest signs of the difference between classical
and merely academic music. There are many melodies of which
the inversion is as natural as the original form, and does not
strikingly alter its character. Such are, for instance, the theme
of Bach&rsquo;s <i>Kunst der Fuge</i>, most of Purcell&rsquo;s contrapuntal themes,
the theme in the fugue of Beethoven&rsquo;s sonata, <i>op.</i> 110, and the
eighth of Brahms&rsquo;s variations on a theme by Haydn. In such
cases inversion sometimes produces harmonic variety as well
as a sense of melodic identity in difference. But where a melody
has marked features of rise and fall, such as long scale passages
or bold skips, the inversion, if productive of good harmonic
structure and expression, may be a powerful method of transformation.
This is admirably shown in the twelfth of Bach&rsquo;s
<i>Goldberg Variations</i>, in the fifteenth fugue of the first book of
his <i>Forty-eight Preludes and Fugues</i>, in the finale of Beethoven&rsquo;s
sonata, <i>op.</i> 106, and in the second subjects of the first and last
movements of Brahms&rsquo;s clarinet trio.</p>

<p>The only remaining canonic device which figures in classical
music is that known as <i>cancrizans</i>, in which the imitating part
reproduces the leader backwards. It is of extreme rarity in
serious music; and, though it sometimes happens by accident
that a melody or figure of uniform rhythm will produce something
equally natural when read backwards, there is only one example
of its use that appeals to the ear as well as the eye. This is to
be found in the finale of Beethoven&rsquo;s sonata, <i>op.</i> 106, where it is
applied to a theme with such sharply contrasted rhythmic and
melodic features that with long familiarity a listener would
probably feel not only the wayward humour of the passage in
itself, but also its connexion with the main theme. Nevertheless,
the prominence given to the device in technical treatises, and the
fact that this is the one illustration which hardly any of them
cite, show too clearly the way in which music is treated not only
as a dead language but as if it had never been alive.</p>

<p>All these devices are also independent of the canonic idea,
since they are so many methods of transforming themes
in themselves and need not always be used in contrapuntal
combination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>2. Fugue.</i></p>

<p>As the composers of the 16th century made progress in harmonic
and contrapuntal expression through the discipline of
strict canonic forms, it became increasingly evident that there
was no necessity for the maintenance of strict canon throughout
a composition. On the contrary, the very variety of canonic
possibilities, apart from the artistic necessity of breaking up the
uniform fulness of harmony, suggested the desirability of changing
one kind of canon for another, and even of contrasting canonic
texture with that of plain masses of non-polyphonic harmony.
The result is best known in the polyphonic 16th-century motets.
In these the essentials of canonic effect are embodied in the entry
of one voice after another with a definite theme stated by each
voice in that part of the scale which best suits its compass, thus
producing a free canon for as many parts as there are voices,
in alternate intervals of the 4th, 5th and octave, and at such
distances of time as are conducive to clearness and variety of
proportion. It is not necessary for the later voices to imitate
more than the opening phrase of the earlier, or, if they do
imitate its continuation, to keep to the same interval.</p>

<p>Such a texture differs in no way from that of the fugue of more
modern times. But the form is not what is now understood as
fugue, inasmuch as 16th-century composers did not normally
think of writing long movements on one theme or of making a
point of the return of a theme after episodes. With the appearance
of new words in the text, the 16th-century composer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>44</span>
naturally took up a new theme without troubling to design it for
contrapuntal combination with the opening; and the form
resulting from this treatment of words was faithfully reproduced
in the instrumental <i>ricercari</i> of the time. Occasionally, however,
breadth of treatment and terseness of design combined to produce
a short movement on one idea indistinguishable in form from a
<i>fughetta</i> of Bach; as in the <i>Kyrie</i> of Palestrina&rsquo;s Mass, <i>Salve
Regina</i>.</p>

<p>But in Bach&rsquo;s art the preservation of a main theme is more
necessary the longer the composition; and Bach has an incalculable
number of methods of giving his fugues a symmetry of form
and balance of climax so subtle and perfect that we are apt to
forget that the only technical rules of a fugue are those which
refer to its texture. In the <i>Kunst der Fuge</i> Bach has shown with
the utmost clearness how in his opinion the various types of
fugue may be classified. That extraordinary work is a series of
fugues, all on the same subject. The earlier fugues show how
an artistic design may be made by simply passing the subject
from one voice to another in orderly succession (in the first example
without any change of key except from tonic to dominant).
The next stage of organization is that in which the subject is
combined with inversions, augmentations and diminutions of
itself. Fugues of this kind can be conveniently called stretto-fugues.<a name="FnAnchor_2e" href="#Footnote_2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
The third and highest stage is that in which the fugue
combines its subject with contrasted counter-subjects, and thus
depends upon the resources of double, triple and quadruple
counterpoint. But of the art by which the episodes are contrasted,
connected climaxes attained, and keys and subtle
rhythmic proportions so balanced as to give the true fugue-forms
a beauty and stability second only to those of the true
sonata forms, Bach&rsquo;s classification gives us no direct hint. A
comparison of the fugues in the <i>Kunst der Fuge</i> with those elsewhere
in his works reveals a necessary relation between the nature
of the fugue-subject and the type of fugue. In <i>Kunst der Fuge</i>
Bach has obvious didactic reasons for taking the same subject
throughout; and, as he wishes to show the extremes of technical
possibility, that subject must necessarily be plastic rather than
characteristic. Elsewhere Bach prefers very lively or highly
characteristic themes as subjects for the simplest kind of instrumental
fugue. On the other hand, there comes a point when the
mechanical strictness of treatment crowds out the proper development
of musical ideas; and the 7th fugue (which is one solid mass
of stretto in augmentation, diminution and inversion) and the
12th and 13th (which are invertible bodily) are academic exercises
outside the range of free artistic work. On the other hand,
the less complicated stretto-fugues and the fugues in double
and triple counterpoint are perfect works of art and as beautiful as
any that Bach wrote without didactic purpose.</p>

<p>Fugue is still, as in the 16th century, a texture rather
than a form; and the rules given in most technical treatises
for its general shape are based, not on the practice of the
great composers, but on the necessities of beginners, whom
it would be as absurd to ask to write a fugue without giving
them a form as to ask a schoolboy to write so many pages of
Latin verses without a subject. But this standard form, whatever
its merits may be in combining progressive technique with
musical sense, has no connexion with the true classical types of
fugue, though it played an interesting part in the renaissance
of polyphony during the growth of the sonata style, and even gave
rise to valuable works of art (<i>e.g.</i> the fugues in Haydn&rsquo;s quartets,
<i>op.</i> 20). One of its rules was that every fugue should have a
stretto. This rule, like most of the others, is absolutely without
classical warrant; for in Bach the ideas of stretto and of counter-subject
almost exclude one another except in the very largest
fugues, such as the 22nd in the second book of the Forty-eight;
while Handel&rsquo;s fugue-writing is a masterly method, adopted
as occasion requires, and with a lordly disdain for recognized
devices. But the pedagogic rule proved to be not without
artistic point in more modern music; for fugue became, since the
rise of the sonata-form, for some generations a contrast with
the normal means of expression instead of being itself normal.
And while this was so, there was considerable point in using
every possible means to enhance the rhetorical force of its
peculiar devices, as is shown by the astonishing modern fugues
in Beethoven&rsquo;s last works. Nowadays, however, polyphony is
universally recognized as a permanent type of musical texture,
and there is no longer any reason why if it crystallizes into the
fugue-form at all it should not adopt the classical rather than
the pedagogic type.</p>

<p>It is still an unsatisfied wish of accurate musicians that the term
fugue should be used to imply rather a certain type of polyphonic
texture than the whole form of a composition. At present one
runs the risk of grotesque misconceptions when one quite rightly
describes as &ldquo;written in fugue&rdquo; such passages as the first subjects
in Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Zauberflöte</i> overture, the andantes of Beethoven&rsquo;s
first symphony and C minor quartet, or the first and second
subjects of the finale of Mozart&rsquo;s G major quartet, the second
subject of the finale of his D major quintet, and the exposition
of quintuple counterpoint in the coda of the finale of the <i>Jupiter
Symphony</i>, and countless other passages in the developments and
main subjects of classical and modern works in sonata form. The
ordinary use of the term implies an adherence to a definite set
of rules quite incompatible with the sonata style, and therefore
inapplicable to these passages, and at the same time equally
devoid of real connexion with the idea of fugue as understood
by the great masters of the 16th century who matured it. In
the musical articles in this Encyclopaedia we shall therefore
speak of writing &ldquo;in fugue&rdquo; as we would speak of a poet writing
in verse, rather than weaken our descriptions by the orthodox
epithet of &ldquo;loose <i>fugato</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>3. Counterpoint on a Canto Fermo.</i></p>

<p>The early practice of building polyphonic designs on a voice-part
confined to a given plain-song or popular melody furnishes
the origin for every contrapuntal principle that is not canonic,
and soon develops into a canonic principle in itself. When the
<i>canto fermo</i> is in notes of equal length and is sung without intermission,
it is of course as rigid a mechanical device as an acrostic.
Yet it may have artistic value in furnishing a steady rhythm
in contrast to suitable free motion in the other parts. When it
is in the bass, as in Orlando di Lasso&rsquo;s six-part <i>Regina Coeli</i>,
it is apt to cramp the harmony; but when it is in the tenor
(its normal place in 16th-century music), or any other part, it
determines little but the length of the composition. It may or
may not appeal to the ear; if not, it at least does no harm, for
its restricting influence on the harmony is small if its pace is
slower than that of its surroundings. If, on the other hand, its
melody is characteristic, or can be enforced by repetition, it
may become a powerful means of effect, as in the splendid close
of Fayrfax&rsquo;s Mass <i>Albanus</i> quoted by Professor Wooldridge
on page 320 in the second volume of the <i>Oxford History of Music</i>.
Here the tenor part ought to be sung by a body of voices that
can be distinctly heard through the glowing superincumbent
harmony; and then the effect of its five steps of sequence in
a melodious figure of nine semibreves will reveal itself as the
principle which gives the passage consistency of drift and finality
of climax.</p>

<p>When the rhythm of the <i>canto fermo</i> is not uniform, or when
pauses intervene between its phrases, whether these are different
figures or repetitions of one figure in different parts of the scale,
the device passes into the region of free art, and an early example
of its simplest use is described in the article MUSIC as it appears
in Josquin&rsquo;s wonderful <i>Miserere</i>. Orlando di Lasso&rsquo;s work is
full of instances of it, one of the most dramatic of which is the
motet <i>Fremuit spiritu Jesus</i> (<i>Magnum Opus</i> No. 553 [378]),
in which, while the other voices sing the scripture narrative
of the death and raising of Lazarus, the tenor is heard singing
to an admirably appropriate theme the words, <i>Lazare, veni
foras</i>. When the end of the narrative is reached, these words fall
into their place and are of course taken up in a magnificent
climax by the whole chorus.</p>

<p>The free use of phrases of <i>canto fermo</i> in contrapuntal texture,
whether confined to one part or taken up in fugue by all,

constitutes the whole fabric of 16th-century music; except where
polyphonic device is dispensed with altogether, as in Palestrina&rsquo;s
two settings of the <i>Stabat Mater</i>, his <i>Litanies</i>, and all of his later
<i>Lamentations</i> except the initials. A 16th-century mass, when
it is not derived in this way from those secular melodies to which
the council of Trent objected, is so closely connected with
Gregorian tones, or at least with the themes of some motet
appropriate to the holy day for which it was written, that in a
Roman Catholic cathedral service the polyphonic music of the
best period co-operates with the Gregorian intonations to produce
a consistent musical whole with a thematic coherence almost
suggestive of Wagnerian <i>Leitmotif</i>. In later times the Protestant
music of Germany attained a similar consistency, under more
complicated musical conditions, by the use of chorale-tunes; and
in Bach&rsquo;s hands the fugal and other treatment of chorale-melody
is one of the most varied and expressive of artistic resources.
It seems to be less generally known that the chorale plays a
considerable though not systematic part in Handel&rsquo;s English
works. The passage &ldquo;the kingdoms of the world&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus&rdquo; (down to &ldquo;and He shall live for ever
and ever&rdquo;) is a magnificent development of the second part of
the chorale <i>Wachet auf</i> (&ldquo;Christians wake, a voice is calling&rdquo;);
and it would be easy to trace a German or Roman origin for many
of the solemn phrases in long notes which in Handel&rsquo;s choruses
so often accompany quicker themes.</p>

<p>From the use of an old <i>canto fermo</i> to the invention of an original
one is obviously a small step; and as there is no limit to the
possibilities of varying the <i>canto fermo</i>, both in the part which
most emphatically propounds it and in the imitating or contrasted
parts, so there is no line of demarcation between the free development
of counterpoint on a <i>canto fermo</i> and the general art of
combining melodies which gives harmony its deepest expression
and musical texture its liveliest action. Nor is there any such
line to separate polyphonic from non-polyphonic methods of
accompanying melody; and Bach&rsquo;s <i>Orgelbüchlein</i> and Brahms&rsquo;s
posthumous organ-chorales show every conceivable gradation
between plain harmony or arpeggio and the most complex canon.</p>

<p>In Wagnerian polyphony canonic devices are rare except in
such simple moments of anticipation or of communion with
nature as we have before the rise of the curtain in the <i>Rheingold</i>
and at the daybreak in the second act of the <i>Götterdämmerung</i>.
On the other hand, the art of combining contrasted themes
crowds almost every other kind of musical texture (except
tremolos and similar simple means of emotional expression)
into the background, and is itself so transformed by new harmonic
resources, many of which are Wagner&rsquo;s own discovery, that it
may almost be said to constitute a new form of art. The influence
of this upon instrumental music is as yet helpful only in those
new forms which are breaking away from the limits of the sonata
style; and it is impossible at present to sift the essential from
the unessential in that marvellous compound of canonic device,
Wagnerian harmony, original technique and total disregard of
every known principle of musical grammar, which renders the
work of Richard Strauss the most remarkable musical phenomenon
of recent years. All that is certain is that the two
elements in which the music of the future will finally place its
main organizing principles are not those of instrumentation and
external expression, on which popular interest and controversy
are at present centred, but rhythmic flow and counterpoint. These
have always been the elements which suffered from neglect or
anarchy in earlier transition-periods, and they have always been
the elements that gave rationality to the new art to which the
transitions led.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTREXÉVILLE</span>, a watering-place of north-eastern France,
in the department of Vosges, on the Vair, 39 m. W. of Épinal by
rail. Pop. (1906) 940. The mineral springs of Contrexéville
have been in local repute since a remote period, but became
generally known only towards the end of the 18th century; and
the modern reputation of the place as a health resort dates from
1864, when it began to be developed by a company, the Société
des Eaux de Contrexéville, and more particularly from about
1895. In the ten years after this latter date many improvements
were made for the accommodation of visitors, for whom the season
is from May to September. The waters of the Source Pavilion,
which are used chiefly for drinking, have a temperature of 53° F.
and are characterized chiefly by the presence of calcium sulphate.
They are particularly efficacious in the treatment of gravel and
kindred disorders, by the elimination of uric acid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTROL</span> (Fr. <i>contrôle</i>, older form <i>contre rolle</i>, from Med. Lat.
<i>contra-rotulus</i>, a counter roll or copy of a document used to check
the original; there is no instance in English of the use of &ldquo;control&rdquo;
in this, its literal, meaning), a substantive (whence the verb)
for that which checks or regulates anything, and so especially
command of body or mind by the will, and generally the power
of regulation. In England the &ldquo;Board of Control,&rdquo; abolished
in 1858, was the body which supervised the East India Company
in the administration of India. In the case of &ldquo;controller,&rdquo;
a general term for a public official who checks expenditure, the
more usual form &ldquo;comptroller&rdquo; is a wrong spelling due to a
false connexion with &ldquo;accompt&rdquo; or &ldquo;account.&rdquo; A &ldquo;control&rdquo;
or &ldquo;control-experiment,&rdquo; in science, is an experiment used, by
an application of the method of difference, to check the inferences
drawn from another experiment.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONTUMACY</span> (Lat. <i>contumacia</i>, obstinacy; derived from the
root <i>tem-</i>, as in <i>temnere</i>, to despise, or possibly from the root
<i>tum-</i>, as in <i>tumere</i>, to swell, with anger, &amp;c.), a stubborn refusal
to obey authority, obstinate resistance; particularly, in law,
the wilful contempt of the order or summons of a court (see
<span class="sc">Contempt of Court</span>). In ecclesiastical law, the contempt of
the authority of an ecclesiastical court is dealt with by the
issue of a writ <i>de contumace capiendo</i> from the court of chancery
at the instance of the judge of the ecclesiastical court; this writ
took the place of that <i>de excommunicato capiendo</i> in 1813, by an
act of George III. c. 127 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Excommunication</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CONUNDRUM</span> (a word of unknown origin, probably coined
in burlesque imitation of scholastic Latin, as &ldquo;hocus-pocus&rdquo;
or &ldquo;panjandrum&rdquo;), originally a term meaning whim, fancy or
ridiculous idea; later applied to a pun or play upon words, and
thus, in its usual sense, to a particular form of riddle in which
the answer depends on a pun. In a transferred sense the word
is also used of any puzzling question or difficulty.</p>

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CONVENT</span> (Lat. <i>conventus</i>, from <i>convenire</i>, to come together),
a term applied to an association of persons secluded from the
world and devoted to a religious life, and hence to the building
in which they live, a monastery or (more particularly) nunnery.
The diminution &ldquo;conventicle&rdquo; (<i>conventiculum</i>), generally used
in a contemptuous sense as implying sectarianism, secrecy or
illegality, is applied to the meetings or meeting-places of religious
or other dissenting bodies.</p>

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CONVENTION</span> (Lat. <i>conventio</i>, an assembly or agreement,
from <i>convenire</i>, to come together), a meeting or assembly; an
agreement between parties; a general agreement on which is
based some custom, institution, rule of behaviour or taste, or
canon of art; hence extended to the abuse of such an agreement,
whereby the rules based upon it become lifeless and artificial.
The word is of some interest historically and politically. It is
used of an assembly of the representatives of a nation, state or
party, and is particularly contrasted with the formal meetings
of a legislature. It is thus applied to those parliaments in English
history which, owing to the abeyance of the crown, have assembled
without the formal summons of the sovereign; in 1660
a convention parliament restored Charles II. to the throne,
and in 1689 the Houses of Commons and Lords were summoned
informally to a convention by William, prince of Orange, as
were the Estates of Scotland, and declared the throne abdicated
by James II. and settled the disposition of the realm. Similarly,
the assembly which ruled France from September 1792 to
October 1795 was known as the National Convention (see below);
the statutory assembly of delegates which framed the constitution
of the United States of America in 1787 was called the Constitutional
Convention; and the various American state constitutions
have been drafted and sometimes revised by constitutional ...</p>
